        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Tonight when we went to the pool room there were these two horrible townies in there.</p>

<p>One of them (I can’t differentiate between the two) asked if he could play me. I said <q>maybe not</q>. While I was sticking the balls in the triangle they asked about my septum piercing. Then they asked if I had a job. Then they asked what job I wanted eventually, I said <q>programmer of some description</q>, they asked how I’d get a job with my septum piercing I said <q>they can take me as I am … or not</q>.</p>

<p>Later on they complained at me because I came in and put loads of money down when they were just about to play. I think I was quite good at having no sympathy at all for them and showing it. I had an <q>ah well, should have put your money on the table</q> attitude. They also whined because they wanted to play the winner.</p>

<p>Then Jenny mentioned that they usually go before we get there and they said something about their bedtime, insulted our social life (by asking if we go to the Blue Boar every Thursday, if we go to nightclubs, etc.; which Cat handled all on her own), and left.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>I went to Wetherspoons with Will to meet Summer and Suze (who I haven’t seen in almost a year). Then we came back to Will’s and watched an hour of Family Guy. I tried his dress on, it looked good but it was too tight around the chest and waist for me to take deep breaths. He said I could have had it if fitted. He’s so sweet.</p>

<p>I need a dress.</p>

<p>I am currently listening to <cite>Enya</cite>’s <cite>Watermark</cite> album. It’s very relaxing and melodic.</p>

<p>I was reading <a href="http://del.icio.us/meredith">Meredith’s del.icio.us</a> today and I found these <a href="http://seabed.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/wallpaper.tmpl?issue_id=20050301">National Graphic wallpapers</a> (change the month in the URI to get other wallpapers). </p>

<p>I’ve been getting into <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> lately. It’s great fun. I have the feeds of several tags in my feed-reader (<a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a> at the moment) such as <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/vegan">vegan</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/lisp">lisp</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/unicode">unicode</a>. It’s fantabulous. I’ve been finding several great things every day.</p>

<p>I’ve also been contributing links, not just reading them. Here’s <a href="http://del.icio.us/holizz">my del.icio.us links</a>.</p>

<p>Just before I go, I found something that looks <em>very</em> good, via <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/rdf">del.icio.us/tag/rdf</a>: <a href="http://vocab.org/relationship/">RELATIONSHIP: A vocabulary for describing relationships between people</a>. Just looking at it, I think it could be very useful (i.e. fun). I expect I’ll do that tomorrow.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Okay, so <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/03/19/love-it-when">that book</a> was quite useless in that it didn’t seem to have much in the way of syntax. I just ordered <cite>
            <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html">ANSI Common Lisp</a>
          </cite> from Amazon. I like CLISP but I’m frustrated by the lack of a single “this is CLISP and this is how you do it” resource on the Web. From what I’ve read of the free (as in beer) chapters this book is that resource; yet it’s not on the Web for some reason.</p>

<p>Speaking of documentation, of all the languages I’ve used <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> is the best for documentation both in terms of tutorials (<a href="http://python.org/doc/2.3.5/tut/tut.html">Python Tutorial</a>) and in self-documentation (<a href="http://python.org/doc/2.3.5/tut/node6.html#SECTION006760000000000000000">Documentation Strings</a>). After using Python for a good few months I thought I’d do something in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>; I missed my doc strings and easy access to the innards of objects sorely.</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/">IKEA</a> with Davina tonight. Great fun. But afterwards we went to <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/">Borders</a>. So. Many. Books. Really, there was a <em>huge</em> selection of books compared to any of the book shops or libraries in the centre of Bradford (at least in the only important sections—sci-fi and computing). As I wandered past the two shelves of “this is how to use this GUI application” books I noticed something very rare and very special: a Python book. No two Python books, no three! I was in heaven. Not that I use Python much these days, but if a book shop or library has Python books you know it’s a good shop. I also saw a book called Fuzzy Logic, Eric Meyer on CSS, More Eric Meyer on CSS, XML Pocket Reference, CSS Pocket Reference. I almost started hyperventilating at one point.</p>

<p>Is Bradford too illiterate to deserve a book shop like that? (Probably). The biggest we have is a medium-sized Waterstones. But wherever-the-hell-that-was has a <em>huge</em> Borders and I think Leeds city centre has several very big book shops.</p>

<p>My trip to the book shop reminded me that I need to get some good sci-fi soon. Like <cite>I, Robot</cite>. The problem there is that I’d have to make the effort to go to the central library and look for it (since it’s not in the university library); and even then it may not be there. Even if I did have the inclination to buy it I wouldn’t buy a Will Smith-covered copy of the book (which is the only copies most book shops seem to be selling lately). I’m sure Will Smith is lovely but as cover art for a book he has no relation to he’s very inappropriate (since the film was based on ideas in I, Robot and not on the book itself).</p>
