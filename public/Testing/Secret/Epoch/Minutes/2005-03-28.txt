18:12 <crimson> Can we start at.... 2005-05-28T18:20 ?
18:12 <holizz> If you like
18:12 <crimson> Did I do it right?
18:12 <holizz> No
18:13 <crimson> *looks sad*
18:13 <holizz> 2005-05-28T18:20:00+01:00 is probably what you meant
18:14 <crimson> Why can't I just use it without the extra bits I don't need?
18:15 <holizz> Because you need it all
18:16 -!- crimson [crimson@kulish.com] has quit [Leaving...]
18:19 -!- crimson [crimson@kulish.com] has quit [Leaving...]
18:19 <holizz> The seconds are of debatable use but without specifying a timezone you could be referring to my 18:20:00 +/- 23 hours
18:21 <crimson> Leave seconds then
18:22 <crimson> Can we declare the meeting open? We do nothing but chat till it's over
18:22 <holizz> Sure we can
18:22 <crimson> Ok
18:22 <crimson> I freely admit I've done very little beyond looking at apache and considering what OS I want installed on the test server
18:23 <holizz> So... first order of business: any appologies?
18:23 <crimson> You've been playing with HTML. How's that gone?
18:23 <crimson> Heh
18:24 <holizz> I haven't done much with it besides creating a page with no html, head, body tags.
18:24 <holizz> http://holizz.com/Testing/HTML/Tester
18:24 <holizz> Which is valid
18:24 <crimson> Is that even valid? The source looks cool
18:24 <crimson> you're thinking of bandwidth already then. that's interesting
18:24 <holizz> It shall save a lot of bytes over XHTML
18:25 <crimson> Would you want these pages made using that lisp thing you showed me earlier? ( http://weitz.de/tbnl/ )
18:26 <holizz> I'm planning on having the whole site served with Lisp. Maybe with a few odd pages served statically to be easy on the server, maybe not.
18:27 <crimson> I was going to say, the amount of abuse that could create...
18:27 <holizz> TBNL seems to be a very good toolkit
18:27 <crimson> Does it scale though
18:27 <holizz> Most of the site will need to be dynamic anyway, so a couple of pages won't matter
18:28 <holizz> I have no idea how well Lisp is under a gazillon hits per second.
18:28 <crimson> Maybe I'll send an email to google, and ask them for advice? A shot in the dark, but it would be good to ask people who have done it before how they started, and how they coped with the scale
18:28 <holizz> I equally have no idea how well any language would be under a gazillon hits
18:28 <crimson> This is my sort of thing to handle, really. Making things work.
18:29 <holizz> Google has a huge array of servers
18:29 <crimson> I know how google works. I'm thinking about how they started
18:29 <holizz> They could handle anything
18:29 <holizz> I see
18:30 <crimson> going from single server to say... 5 or 6 servers will be a big step
18:30 <crimson> A fucking HUGE step
18:30 <holizz> Maybe there are papers about it
18:30 <crimson> We need to think about what we are doing _now_. Else we'll end up need a 50ghz machine
18:31 <crimson> I'm happy with functions being shown as f(x) ;I'm editing the wiki
18:32 <crimson> Jesus. I had to turn off some options in MSN, as (x) displays an emotion of a small lady. I hate that
18:32 <holizz> Ha
18:33 <holizz> I've never liked graphic emotes
18:33 <crimson> We digress
18:33 <crimson> Lets talk about story
18:33 <crimson> Is a story an array of moments, and anti-moments?
18:34 <holizz> It's not an array at all
18:34 <crimson> (A list of times when you should be doing something, and then a list of times where things are different (an anti-moment being: I do not want to do anything on Tuesday))
18:34 <crimson> Could it be
18:35 <holizz> An array is a fixed-sized set of objects of the same type. It will never be that
18:35 <crimson> Assume my language is at time a little free-er than yours
18:35 <crimson> Define a story.
18:35 <crimson> Is it a collection of moments?
18:36 <holizz> It has something to do with epochs
18:36 <crimson> heh. you don't know either
18:36 <holizz> Of course not
18:36 <crimson> I think a story is a list of epochs
18:37 <crimson> an epoch and an anti-epoch are the same thing, really
18:37 <holizz> Maybe a story doesn't exist at all
18:38 <crimson> Shit. Do we need a way to assign priorities to epochs? (Going to the doctors might be more important than FTCing)
18:38 <holizz> This will be something to be implemented in the database, not in epoch lang
18:39 <holizz> Epoch is all about time
18:39 <crimson> Understood
18:39 <crimson> And what does it allow us to do with time
18:39 <holizz> One can not do much with time, yet time does a lot with one.
18:40 <crimson> Now you're being obtuse.
18:40 <holizz> I'm being cryptic.
18:40 <crimson> At the moment I see it able to define when things are happening
18:40 <holizz> That's right
18:41 <crimson> Now things happen in amounts. This makes me think we need some way to collect together multiple events
18:41 <crimson> Which is what a story is
18:41 <crimson> Jesus. This lang would actually work in java. That makes me ill
18:41 <holizz> I'm thinking we may not need a story at all
18:41 <holizz> It will work in all languages with great APIs
18:42 <crimson> Oh? Just instant moment and epoch?
18:42 <holizz> We have functions
18:43 <crimson> You might be right about the story
18:43 <crimson> It seems like something that might work better in a database
18:44 <holizz> There. See my update to Formal definition
18:44 <holizz> The example section at the end
18:45 <holizz> We don't even need moments as a seperate syntax
18:45 <holizz> Just instants
18:45 <holizz> We don't need epochs either
18:45 <holizz> Just expressions
18:46 <crimson> Told you we didn't need epochs
18:47 <holizz> Just instants, symbols, and expressions
18:47 <crimson> how does it know what 1day is?
18:47 <holizz> I haven't worked that out yet
18:47 <crimson> This might never be relevant, but, our basic unit of time is the second. Right?
18:48 <holizz> Maybe it is... maybe it isn't
18:49 <crimson> Right. Give me an answer please. With some reasoning.
18:49 <holizz> I thought the datetime was... but maybe it isn't
18:50 <crimson> We could have a way of adding instants and moments together
18:50 <holizz> If it isn't we'd need some native syntax... maybe using numbers
18:50 <holizz> Adding instants and moments?
18:50 <holizz> You mean like a union?
18:50 <crimson> Well, something like that
18:51 <crimson> If you have 2 week long moments, and add them together, then you end up with a single 1 week long moment
18:51 <crimson> Or:
18:52 <holizz> I don't follow
18:52 <crimson> that way if you have the instant today, which is 2005-05-28 and add the unit of 1day, then it'd know just to add 1 to 27, because it knows that that is the way to go
18:52 <crimson> Or, if you have the moment of 'Go to spain for a week'
18:53 <crimson> Then decide you need a few more days, you could just have a way to say to it "add a couple of days". Rather than redefining it
18:54 <holizz> set(spain,moment(today,+(today,week)))
18:55 <holizz> week being defined beforehand as 7 days, of course
18:55 <crimson> and it knows what days are, through some sore of regex
18:55 <holizz> How do you figure that?
18:56 <crimson> I don't know
18:57 <crimson> If you told it to 'add a day'. I'm guessing it would be able to work out that:
18:57 <crimson> 2005-01-01 + 1day = 2005-01-02 ?
18:58 <holizz> See updated examples
18:58 <holizz> sec is a builtin unit
18:58 <crimson> Noted
18:59 <holizz> dt() gives a datetime from a symbol
18:59 <holizz> Hmm
18:59 <holizz> This is complicated
19:00 <crimson> dt() gives a datetime from a symbol <- what?
19:01 <holizz> It returns the internal representation of a datetime which will be derived from the argument, which is a symbol in this case
19:01 <holizz> This need not be a language in and of itself. It could simply be a library.
19:02 <crimson> I think it starts like that, then might need to develop, and might not
19:02 <crimson> In lisp, I assume?
19:03 <holizz> Yes.
19:03 <holizz> I'm not using any other language at the moment.
19:04 <crimson> shall we close the book on this portion of the meeting? Or were there more things to bring up?
19:05 <holizz> I didn't have anything to bring up
19:05 <crimson> You didn't want the meeting, right?
19:05 <holizz> Wrong.
19:05 <crimson> Heh
19:05 <crimson> Ok
19:05 <crimson> My next issue was: Stuff for me to do
19:05 <holizz> What's the next part of the meeting?
19:06 <holizz> Then I shall ask: what _can
19:06 <holizz> _ you do
19:06 <holizz> ?
19:06 <holizz> On three lines
19:06 <crimson> Just about anything I set my mind to, apart from sport
19:07 <holizz> Next question: what would you like to do?
19:08 <crimson> Sigh. Something of use. I have a vauge idea that SQL could be useful for me to know
19:08 <crimson> What kind of database server did you want to use? I know you can be religious at times, so asking is a good place to start
19:08 <holizz> Not about databases.
19:08 <crimson> mySQL?
19:09 <holizz> There are more important things in life, like persecuting Windows users.
19:09 <crimson> Excellent
19:09 <crimson> So SQL is on my list.
19:09 <crimson> Hmm. I think there was something else
19:09 <holizz> MySQL is good as far as I can tell. You ought to investigate other RDBMSes
19:10 <holizz> Wait, we're not finished with you.
19:10 <crimson> We are legion?
19:10 <holizz> Legion?
19:10 <crimson> joke
19:10 <holizz> You'll have to explain it
19:10 <crimson> Our current time frame for a server to be up and running is about 25 days, give or take
19:10 <crimson> It's not worth it
19:10 <crimson> What else do you have for me?
19:10 <holizz> one ady
19:11 <holizz> day, even
19:11 <holizz> Which of the following topics would you like to read up on:
19:12 <holizz> Usability, HTML, uhhh... tying shoelaces?
19:12 <holizz> Oooh, it would be useful if you could try out various calendar apps, like Windows ones
19:12 <crimson> Did you get the link I sent?
19:13 <crimson> Calender apps, good. I'll write it on my list
19:13 <holizz> I saw it, yes
19:13 <crimson> Can you make yourself a things to do page, or something that records what you've learnt in relation to the project?
19:13 <holizz> Sure
19:13 <crimson> I might even try to get onto slashdot, asking for feedback
19:13 <crimson> When we're done, can you get this onto the wiki as soon as possible?
19:14 <holizz> Get what onto it? All of it?
19:14 <holizz> You mean the chatlog?
19:14 <holizz> Sure
19:15 <crimson> Ok
19:15 <crimson> Are we done?
19:15 <holizz> If you like
19:16 <crimson> Meeting closed
19:16 <crimson> Call it.
19:16 <holizz> You're a taxi, meeting
