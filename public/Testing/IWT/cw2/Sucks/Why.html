<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>There are many reasons for buying an alternative keyboard.</p>

<ul>
<li>A disibility meaning a normal keyboard would not be easy to use (for those with less than two hands, maybe) or may cause excessive pain (such as in the case of <abbr title="Carpel Tunnel Syndrome">CTS</abbr>)</li>
<li>Want to prevent future problems such as <abbr title="Repetitive Strain Injury">RSI</abbr></li>
<li>The coolness factor of having a one-handed keyer</li>
</ul>

<p>So what are you waiting for? Whether you have a serious problem with your thumbs or you just want to show off, buy an alternative keyboard <strong>today</strong>!</p>
