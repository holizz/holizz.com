1 Goals

1.1 AltKeys sells alternative keyboards and keyers.

1.2 AltKeys' website is their only store. Without the web, AltKeys would find it next-to-impossible to break even since alternate keyboards are such a nieche market

1.2.1 What? TODO

1.2.2 Of course! They shall add new keyboards to the line already offered

1.2.3 Sure! The goal of any start-up is to sell themselves to somebody, right?

1.3 Ideally, everybody who uses a keyboard; realistically, disabled people and those who think ahead and don't want to be disabled by RSI. There are no members. To attract new customers. The affluent type who like keyboards. No, anybody is welcome to buy from us.

1.4 Because they want a good keyboard. Duh.

4 Site Structure

4.1 Okay, done that.

4.2 See overleaf.

4.3 There's a navigation bar on the left on every page. I'm not stupid enough to leave pages with no navigation.

4.3.1 Done.

4.3.2 Only top-level nav.

4.3.3 It's just fine as it is.
