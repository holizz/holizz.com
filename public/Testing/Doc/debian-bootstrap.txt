login as root

(the # indicates it's a command to type in as root ($ indicates it's a command for the normal user), don't type it)

# vi /etc/apt/sources.list

(no, emacs isn't included by default)

insert the following line:
deb http://amd64.debian.org/debian-amd64/ testing main

(type i to enter insert mode, type it in, press Escape to get back to normal mode, type :wq to write and quit)

# apt-get update

to update your packages list

This searches for packages:

# apt-cache search term

This tells you more about a package once it's installed:

# apt-cache show package-name

This installs a package:

# apt-get install package-name

(for which you can give a list of packages seperated by spaces)

I recommend installing:

xserver-xfree86 (the GUI that KDE and other things run on)
kdm (the thing you log into when X starts)
kdebase (KDE)
synaptic (a GUI front-end to APT)

And then rebooting:

# reboot

(you could do it without rebooting but the next time you boot it should run X and kdm without you having to spend much time in bash)

You should now have KDE which you can login to, and synaptic from which you can install packages.
