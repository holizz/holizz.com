        <p>Fired.</p>

<p>It was only a voluntary job, but it was still the best damn job I ever had.</p>

<p>My job was to Web master for <a href="http://www.southsquarecentre.co.uk/">South Square Centre</a>. I put a lot of time and effort into it. See <a href="http://lamp.inf.brad.ac.uk:59279/2005/01/2005-01-18_fired.jpg">screen dump</a> from today (my lovely Trinity style!).</p>

<p>I was fired because the trainee curator of the <a href="http://www.southsquarecentre.co.uk/gallery/">gallery</a> apparently has to &#x201C;design and maintain a Web site&#x201D; as part of her training. I personally think it&#x2019;s a bad idea to force people who may know nothing about computers to &#x201C;design and maintain a Web site&#x201D;, especially when there may be better people for the job. If a curator trained at the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/">Tate</a> (very popular gallery in London), for example, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t be <em>allowed</em> to create and maintain the Tate&#x2019;s Web site. Why would whatever body is examining Bob expect her to be able to do things in more than one field well? It&#x2019;s like expecting computer geeks to have a thorough understanding of sociology. Curators should <em>curate</em> and Web designers should <em>design Web sites</em>.</p>

<p>I have no ill will towards Bob or anybody else at South Square. I&#x2019;m just a little pissed-off as I&#x2019;m sure is understandable.</p>

<p>I spent so much effort on that Web site. I wrote a CMS, I wrote a Makefile to simplify backups (MySQL and source dumps), compiling (using the Python code to generate a static copy of the data in the MySQL database), uploading and cleaning (deleting everything that can be re-generated). I even did a fucking usability test! Sure the test wasn&#x2019;t very good, but I got <em>vital</em> information from it (the participant thought the &#x201C;gallery&#x201D; anchor would link to a gallery of art rather than information about the gallery).</p>

<p>For completeness: Here&#x2019;s the <a href="http://lamp.inf.brad.ac.uk:59279/2005/01/final_ssq_dump/">final dump</a> of the source and MySQL table. Anything written by me (i.e. the code) is GPL, anything written by others (i.e. some of the site content) is copyright them.</p>

<p>Oh, and I had the Foundations of HCI exam (my only exam this exam period) today. It didn&#x2019;t go too well. Terribly, in fact&#x2014;as bad as my psychology exams went last year and the year before that, I&#x2019;d say. I understand and love HCI but I just couldn&#x2019;t answer the questions, much like psychology. I know and can apply the knowledge but it doesn&#x2019;t come through in my exams.</p>

<p>All-in-all, not a good day.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Inspired by Buncey&#x2019;s most recent <a href="http://buncimate.blogspot.com/2005/01/when-i-gwow-up.html">entry</a>, I shall now speak at great length (yeah, right) about what <em>I</em> wanted to do when I grew up (I&#x2019;m unsure as to whether it should be &#x2018;grew&#x2019; or &#x2018;grow&#x2019;).</p>

<p>My first memory of &#x201C;what I want to do when I grow up&#x201D; was that I wanted to be an aerodynamic engineer. Probably because at that time I had a preoccupation with paper aeroplanes. Coming to think of it, it was almost like programming. There was a car advert where this man threw a paper aeroplane and it came back to him; he&#x2019;d designed it such that it would fly in a circle and return to him. The concept of aerodynamics fascinated me.</p>

<p>I couldn&#x2019;t help mentioning it: Theme Park. Great game. But I never wanted to be a theme park manager or lay rubber tubing (or tubbing as I referred to it). That&#x2019;s just <em>crazy</em>.</p>

<p>Next I wanted to be a game developer. Probably around the time I was very into Oddworld (i.e. before Munch&#x2019;s Oddysee and before Oddworld Forums imploded). I expect I realised game development involved effort (back then I didn&#x2019;t know about &#x2018;crunches&#x2019; and EA Games). Then I gave up on that idea. I think I was doing very simple things in C and C++ back then.</p>

<p>Then several years past where I had no idea what I wanted to do &#x201C;when I grew up&#x201D;. I wouldn&#x2019;t have minded but those few years included my A-Levels where knowing what I wanted to do could have been useful. In fact when I applied to UCAS for university last December (<em>late</em> December&#x2014;possibly even early January&#x2014;when the deadline was 17 January (2004-01-17)) I applied to several Teaching courses and &#x201C;<a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/courses/interactive-multimedia/index.shtm">Interactive Multimedia</a>&#x201D; at Lincoln University (on the Hull campus). I later regretted this decision and applied through Clearing to the University of Bradford to do Computer Science. I didn&#x2019;t quite have the grades but they obviously had a few spare places, which was good because the first year is mostly below me so the foundation year (which I had the UCAS points for) would have been pure hell.</p>

<p>And do I know what I want to do &#x201C;when I grow up&#x201D; now? I think a career in Web design would be good. Coding. Possibly even some usability work.</p>

<p>At the moment I don&#x2019;t know whether I want to work for a company or work freelance or even start my own small business. The small business idea could be fun. There&#x2019;d be a server running CVS so everybody could contribute to one project without excessive emails of &#x201C;here&#x2019;s the file&#x2026;&#x201D; and there&#x2019;d be a Wiki. But looking past the fun part, it would be difficult to organise and possibly hard to get work. I could always do that as a side job, possibly with a friend or two if it&#x2019;s a big project.</p>
