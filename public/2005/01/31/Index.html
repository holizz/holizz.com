        <p>Stoned.</p>

<p>I suppose you&#x2019;d like to know how a nice Straight Edge person like myself came to be in such a state of affairs. It would be a funny story if I didn&#x2019;t hate the experience so much.</p>

<p>Okay, so Niall calls me at about 10pm or something last night (2005-01-30) reminding me about this party I was invited to. So I wander off to his halls. Somebody else is waiting at the door when I prank Niall to let me in. I later learn that she is called Jane (this has very little to do with anything; I&#x2019;m just setting the scene). Amanda lets me and Jane in and we meet Niall on the stairwell (as the party was on the second floor). She mentions this &#x201C;special vegan cake&#x201D;. I assume its veganity is the only particularly special thing about it. <strong>FATAL MISTAKE NUMBER ONE</strong>.</p>

<p>So I&#x2019;m offered a piece of cake and I accept. I eat some of it, it&#x2019;s quite nice. Then I find out the <em>other</em> special feature of the cake: it has cannabis in it. At this point I am thinking &#x201C;Oh shit&#x2026;&#x201D;. She said there was &#xA3;35 of weed in it. I think that rather than forcing myself to throw up, it would be easier just to put up with it. After all, I didn&#x2019;t eat that great a portion of the cake. <strong>FATAL MISTAKE NUMBER TWO</strong>.</p>

<p>So by the time I get home at about 2&#x2013;3am, I am <em>really</em> stoned and I am <em>really</em> not enjoying it. I then write the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#x2019;m not in control, even of my own body.</p>

<p>This is terrible, all my senses are blurred. I <em>really</em> don&#x2019;t like it.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I would normally go to bed and read&#x201D; I was thinking. And now I can&#x2019;t, because my mind&#x2019;s all blurred. I wouldn&#x2019;t understand it in this state. This is a terrible feeling. I&#x2019;m having trouble typing, by Space! It&#x2019;s not nice at all. Argh. I&#x2019;m going to go to bed now, because it&#x2019;s making me feel so odd.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At least I earned one thing from my experience, I now have a very good idea as to why I do not do drugs: I like to be in control of my own body.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m still slightly stoned, it&#x2019;s not a nice feeling.</p>

<p>I believe I learned some valuble lessons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check for undesireable ingredients other than eggs, milk and honey in cakes.</li>
<li>
            <strong>DO NOT ACCEPT CAKES FROM <del>STRANGERS</del> <ins>ANYONE</ins>
            </strong>.</li>
<li>Throwing up is better than pure hell.</li>
</ol>

<p>Drugs are fantastic things to some people, but to me they are pure hell.</p>
