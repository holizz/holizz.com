        <p>FQ TOPIC: Help.</p>

<p>FQ1: What happened the last time you needed help?</p>

<p>Will told me NetBSD had floppies, which I hadn&#x2019;t previously noticed.</p>

<p>FQ2: What happened the last time you helped somebody else?</p>

<p>I expect Stuart added that bit of code to his <code>Library.java</code>.</p>

<p>FQ3: What happened the last time you helped yourself?</p>

<p>Not much. I helped myself to some malt loaf.</p>

<p>FQ ASSIST: Do something to help somebody today! Got a few extra dollars? Donate it to the Tsunami Relief Efforts (like the Red Cross at Amazon) or some other worthy cause. Don&#x2019;t have a few dollars to spare? Take a minute and use a FREE "click-to-donate" site (like The Hunger Site) or other worthy activity. How did you help today?</p>

<p>I was planning on donating that &#xA3;15 I still owe to Comic Relief to Debian or the Wikipedia when I got my next loan payment. But today I was planning on doing some thinking and planning relating to a Free AO/AE clone, which I&#x2019;ve been thinking about for a while.</p>

<p>3 new things you want to try in the next 12 months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn another language or learn more of a language I already know.</li>
<li>Contribute something (software, probably) useful to the world. I think I&#x2019;m at a point where I can write something useful (wasn&#x2019;t my Gravatar cache useful? Apparently not as nobody used it) or at least contribute something useful to an existing project.</li>
<li>Enjoying a completely new field that I haven&#x2019;t tried before (i.e. outside of computing). Inside computing, artificial intelligence would be an interesting field to study. There&#x2019;s a module on it next year, I shall probably take it&#x2014;the final-year AI For Games is sponsored by Microsoft so I probably won&#x2019;t touch it with a barge pole unless I suddenly develop an intense interest in AI and games (which I could learn about from a million other sources&#x2014;and I probably will at some point).</li>
</ul>

<p>3 things you want in a relationship (love is a given):</p>

<li>I am considering installing Microsoft Windows as my main OS</li>
</ul>
<p>Go on, guess.</p>

<p>3 physical things about a love interest that appeal to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Body modifications</li>
<li>The size of their &#x2026; flash disk</li>
<li>I ran out of sensible and ironic answers</li>
</ul>

<p>3 things you just can&#x2019;t do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Java. It&#x2019;s painful and frustrating</li>
<li>Be needlessly mean</li>
<li>Spend more than 10 minutes installing software using floppies. It just irritates me so</li>
</ul>

<p>3 of your favorite hobbies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coding</li>
<li>Learning</li>
<li>Dancing</li>
</ul>

<p>3 careers you&#x2019;re considering:</p>
<ol>
<li>Web programming. Coding all day. Good fun</li>
<li>Web usability. Less fun than pure coding but still good</li>
<li>Miscellaneous programming. Not for Electronic Arts though</li>
</ol>

<p>3 places you want to go on <del>vacation</del> <ins>holiday</ins>:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don&#x2019;t mind where I go on holiday as long as I get to code and learn</li>
<li>But I wouldn&#x2019;t mind going to Sweden or</li>
<li>Finland</li>
</ol>

<p>3 kids&#x2019; names (either boy or girl):</p>
<ul>
<li>Holly</li>
<li>Hmm</li>
<li>Hmm</li>
</ul>

<p>3 things you want to do before you die:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-actualise. I may or may not have already self-actualised. At the moment I spend all my time doing enjoyable things that I like doing, including learning. So maybe I am self-actualised. I haven&#x2019;t taken the time to ponder about that lately.</li>
<li>Contribute lots of useful software (and maybe other stuff like a book) to the world.</li>
<li>Learn new things: specifically I want to learn more psychology and another language to a level where I&#x2019;m almost as good as a native user of the language.</li>
</ul>

<p>3 people who have to take this quiz now (unless you&#x2019;re too chicken!):</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#x2019;m</li>
<li>Not</li>
<li>Forcing &#x2026; anyone</li>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Catchy title, eh?</p>

<p>I am currently pondering a free clone of Oddworld: Abe&#x2019;s Oddysee/Exoddus. It should certainly be done. I have fond memories of that game. Anybody interested (in writing code, doing artwork or is simply interested in the idea) should contact a user named <code>holizz</code> via a host named <code>gmail.com</code>.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m thinking either Python/Pygame for speed, clarity and portability of code or C++/SDL for speed of execution. Possibly even C++/SDL (for the engine) <em>and</em> Python (for the logic). The only problem is that I&#x2019;ve forgotten most of the C++ I knew and I&#x2019;ve never used SDL and I&#x2019;m not that good with Pygame. But I&#x2019;ll learn what I need to when the language is decided upon.</p>

<p>It should be fun to write, whatever language/library I choose. A rather multidisciplinary endeavour. Games aren&#x2019;t a field I&#x2019;ve done much work in previously so it will be exciting.</p>
