        <p>I got onto thinking about self-actualisation today. Rather than spend many hours pondering (thus taking away precious time from my latest project which will be unveiled shortly), I thought I&#x2019;d do a <a href="http://www.valeriecoach.com/self-actualizing.html" title="Self-Actualization Quiz">quiz</a>.</p>

<p>For those non-geeks: T means true, NIL means false and then there&#x2019;s <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/mu.html">Mu</a>, which means the question makes no sense or doesn&#x2019;t apply to me.</p>

<ol>
<li>
            <strong>Overall, I make growth choices as opposed to fear choices.</strong> T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I listen to my own voice, discover my own preferences and adhere to them.</strong> T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am honest, don&#x2019;t play games and am self-responsible.</strong> T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I dare to be different: a non-conformist, unpopular and socially courageous when need be.</strong> Not sure about <em>socially</em> courageous. But I try. Unpopular? Me? &lt;span class="sarcasm"&gt;I think I think I may just about fit into the non-conformist category.&lt;/span&gt; Uh, I mean, I won&#x2019;t conform to your fascist categories! (Phew, I almost lost my credibility as a non-conformist there ;). T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am willing to arduously prepare, do the thing I want to do well and be as good as I can be.</strong> I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ve ever had to arduously prepare for anything I wanted to do. Mu/T (actual answer: Mu, answer for statistics: T).</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am a good judge and can easily detect falseness in things and people.</strong> This would be a good case for interviews rather than self-completion questionnaires: I&#x2019;m not sure what the question is asking. Mu and since I doubt I&#x2019;d be good at detecting falseness in people: /NIL.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am open-minded and withhold judgement of the unknown.</strong> I&#x2019;d say T for the most part. I have been known to jump to conclusions (think UML).</li>
<li>
            <strong>I appreciate instinctual pleasures in a balanced, uninhibited way.</strong> I&#x2019;d say T. I like eating and exercise although I don&#x2019;t get enough of either. I dislike masturbation. Pretty balanced.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I love, honour and respect myself.</strong> Of course I do. How could I not love the best hacker in Bradford, possibly even Yorkshire? I just Googled for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hacker+yorkshire">hacker yorkshire</a> and found no hackers living in Yorkshire on the first page. Therefore I am the <em>only</em> hacker in Yorkshire. And yes, I do love the only hacker in Yorkshire. (Hehe). T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I have a wide range of interests and tastes.</strong> I must admit that computing is where the vast majority of my attention and time goes. I like other things. But they&#x2019;re just not as important. NIL.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I have a mission or goal which gets a lot of my time and energy.</strong> T. My mission is, ultimately, to become a great hacker (specialising in the Web, of course). It&#x2019;s entirely possible that I could fail at this goal but I see no reason why considering my estimated life carries on for around another sixty years. I&#x2019;ve learnt this much in 20 years, I&#x2019;m sure I can become a great hacker.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am concerned with philosophical questions.</strong> Not particularly. NIL.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I use privacy for constructive solitude.</strong> T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am teachable and eager to learn from all sources.</strong> As I say, I love nothing more than learning. T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I have strong feelings for humanity/community consciousness.</strong> In what sense? I think Gaia, as implemented in the Foundation series, would be a fantastic thing. Mu/T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am creative, original and inventive.</strong> I&#x2019;d certainly say so. Although at the moment I&#x2019;ve been stuck in a loop. I&#x2019;ve written two CMSes already this year and I wrote one just before the new year and I wrote one a few months back for <a href="http://www.southsquarecentre.co.uk/">South Square</a> (by Space, it&#x2019;s changed, I shall blog about it and post it after this one). T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I have a small (or large) group of friends interested in personal growth and service.</strong> Uh. I&#x2019;m sure most of my friends love personal growth. But to what extent I could not say. I&#x2019;ll say T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I have deep, profound, loving and empathic relationships.</strong> I&#x2019;m not sure I have many relationships like that. NIL.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am kind and respectful to others.</strong> T. I&#x2019;m always polite and respectful. Except inaccessible Web designers. I send them hate mail. But after reading a recent <a href="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/01_26_2005.html">post on Dooce</a>, I realise it may not be the best way of going about things. Stay tuned for polite email I send to the Web masters of Web sites that annoy me to death.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am able to enjoy and accept process/being in transition.</strong> I enjoy it more than I used to, so T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I believe in the metaphysical concept of &#x201C;universal good&#x201D;.</strong> I&#x2019;m not sure I do. I thing Socrates had an idea of Universal good as have many philosophers since, but I think in that respect the pre-Socratic philosophers had it right. Wow. I just applied some knowledge I gained from <cite>
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie%27s_World">Sophie&#x2019;s World</a>
            </cite> NIL.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I experience things fully and vividly, keeping my awareness in the present moment.</strong> But of course. T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I am calm, serene and objective about problems.</strong> Most problems. T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I enjoy being playful. I take life seriously and myself lightly.</strong> T.</li>
<li>
            <strong>I typically act instead of react.</strong> In what situation? Mu/T.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then I count my Ts: 20</p>

<ul>
<li>0&#x2013;6: Self-actualization is still just a concept. Are you ready to explore it further?</li>
<li>6&#x2013;11: You&#x2019;ve made a good beginning. Are you ready to up the ante?</li>
<li>11&#x2013;16: You&#x2019;re almost halfway there. What&#x2019;s next?</li>
<li>16&#x2013;25: Go for the stretch!</li>
</ul>

<p>Woop, I rule.</p>
