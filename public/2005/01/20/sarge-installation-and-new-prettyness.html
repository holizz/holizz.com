        <p>I am writing to you from <code>tty2</code> while the <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> Sarge/Testing installer is downloading packages in <code>tty1</code>. It&#x2019;s very exciting. Well, not really. I installed Stable from CD-ROM before but I replaced it with Knoppix after a short while of being thoroughly confused. Now I&#x2019;m 1337er and I understand how to use Debian&#x2019;s APT tools. Before this I spent a good few hours backing up everything in my home directory to my smaller hard disk, including about 6 GB of <code>~/media/</code>.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, I implemented a new style recently. I think I wrote most of it in the early hours of this morning. It has no name. I shall now explain my thoughts behind it. (Yes, I am about to explain a pretty CSS style-sheet from a text-only terminal).</p>

<p>As you can probably see, the vast majority of the page is just entries. There&#x2019;s no blogroll at the side to squash the entries. The blogroll is at the bottom as an inline list, which probably makes it harder to scan but I think it&#x2019;s advantageous to keep it out of the way. The font size is left up to the user as it really has no major effect upon the design.</p>

<p>The image was fun. The &#x2018;H&#x2019; is a Unicode character I thought looked nice. The rest of &#x201C;Holizz&#x201D; is the font Isabelle. The hand writing was, of course, a Unicode character, possibly in &#x2018;Dingbats&#x2019;. &#x201C;versus the Web&#x201D; was, uh, well I don&#x2019;t know.</p>

<p>For some annoying reason Opera likes to render the navigation links incorrectly. One on top of the other, rather than next to each other. Apparently the navigation list works in IE, which is surprising.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m well on my way to having everything installed again. Just like last time, only better.</p>

<p>Deary me, I just discovered that the base installation doesn&#x2019;t include <code>bzip2</code>! That means I&#x2019;ll have to install it before I can start untarring everything. What a heinous crime!</p>

<p>Well then. Everything&#x2019;s downloaded and I configured my configurations and Sarge rules. Like Knoppix (Debian-based) but cleaner because it doesn&#x2019;t have all the crap Knoppix had.</p>
