        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>So I had this <abbr title="Key Skills for Computing Professionals">KSCP</abbr> coursework. It was mostly multiple-choice, based on content from the course text with a couple of fun questions at the end. And by fun I mean more than five possible answers.</p>

<p>The first one asks: <q>Briefly, describe a topic from the book which you found interesting.</q>
        </p>

<p>My response to this was as follows; [the book being Computer Confluence (concise fifth edition) by George Beekman]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The book wrongly claims: <q>The emerging international standard double-byte character set called Unicode<ins>&#x2026;</ins>
              <del> is designed to facilitate multilingual computing</del>
            </q>. My piece is on an encoding of Unicode which, unlike the one described in the book, exists<ins> (UTF-16 uses two bytes per character, except when it doesn&#x2019;t)</ins>.</p>

<p>UTF-8, 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format (the most commonly used Unicode encoding), uses a variable number of bytes per character depending on the code point being depicted. One byte is used for code points in the range of U+0000 to U+007F. With one-byte characters, UTF-8 is identical to US-ASCII. UTF-8 characters may have from one to four bytes depending on their position in Unicode. One advantage of using UTF-8 is that it can represent characters in a way that&#x2019;s backwards compatible with US-ASCII using one byte per character but also represent any other character in Unicode. This is a large advantage in authoring texts which mostly use characters in Basic Latin (the section of Unicode which is equivalent to US-ASCII), such as English, French, Esperanto. However, in texts requiring more and higher code points (i.e. in Chinese or Japanese text) UTF-8 can produce larger files than other encodings such as UTF-16 or UTF-32.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely neglected <em>how</em> UTF-8 works, but the question was only worth three marks so neh.</p>

<p>I then go on to discover that one of the multiple choice questions is wrong (post submission, unfortunately):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Unicode coding system can provide how many different representations?</p>
<ul>
<li>2</li>
<li>4</li>
<li>16</li>
<li>256</li>
<li>about 65,000</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought 65,000 was a little low but it&#x2019;s the only one that makes the slightest bit of sense (it&#x2019;s also the answer the book gives) so I go ahead and circle the fifth answer.</p>

<p>Later on in the day, inspired by the recent spate of UTF-related swoting (mostly on the Wikipedia article <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>) I was reading an article called <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/26/UTF">UTF</a> (on the subject of UTF, strangely) by Sun-folk Tim Bray in which a few particular sentences caught my attention: [emphasis mine]</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/26/UTF">
<p>Unicode currently defines just under <strong>100,000</strong> characters, but has space for <strong>1,114,112</strong> code points. They are organised into 17 <q>planes</q> of 2<sup>16</sup> (<strong>65,536</strong>) characters, numbered 0 through 16.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there are <strong>100,000</strong> characters at the moment, with a possibility of <strong>1,114,112</strong> and <strong>65,536</strong> characters in each plane. So the actual answer is <strong>1,114,112</strong>.</p>

<p>The moral of this story is that you should never trust what you read. Ever.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Bit late, as usual. But look at me using all those ISO country/language codes!</p>

<dl>
<dt>FQ1: What&#x2019;s your native language? Do you speak any foreign languages? If so, how did you come to learn them?</dt>
<dd>
<p>My first language is English (en-GB). I learnt French and German a bit but I forgot it all.</p>
<p>My second language is <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> (sgn-GB). I learnt it at Bradford College about two years ago and I still remember a fair bit. I&#x2019;d been wanting to learn it for much longer though. It&#x2019;s also the reason I am careful when I use the term <q>foreign language</q> because it is neither my first language nor is it foreign.</p>
<p>My third language is Esperanto (eo), which is also not a foreign language, since it is an international language and not of or belonging to any region.</p>
<p>I expect Italian (it) shall be my fourth language. I shall be learning it over the Summer vacation at the same time as John, then we&#x2019;ll come back and talk to each other in Italian.</p>
</dd>

<dt>FQ2: What&#x2019;s your native country? Have you visited any foreign countries? If so, which ones?</dt>
<dd>Born in England (GB) and I have lived here for all 19 of my years. I have visited: Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland (all GB), Ireland (IE), France (FR), Germany (DE), United States of America (US).</dd>

<dt>FQ3: Are there any foreign foods, books, movies, or other items that you are particularly fond of? Name some of your favorites.</dt>
<dd>
<p>As a resident of Bradford (damn, no region-code for that one) I am treated to excellent availability of central/southern Asian (I need to research what to call that part of Asia) cuisine and I am rather fond of it. I enjoy eastern Asian cuisine too. That&#x2019;s where tofu comes from. Did you know that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> got me into natto?</p>
<p>As far as books go, I&#x2019;ve read Sophie&#x2019;s World (the English translation).</p>
<p>I am fond of many foreign films, I&#x2019;ve seen a lot. I&#x2019;m not sure much beats Am&#xE9;lie or End of Evangelion.</p>
<p>I also like gender-neutral pronouns. Such as ri in Riismo in Esperanto or h&#xE4;n/se in Finnish.</p>
</dd>

<dt>FQ NATIVE: If you had to trade your nationality for that of any foreign country, which would you choose and why?</dt>
<dd>Mu. However I can imagine moving to another country semi-permanently. That would be fun. Hell, anything&#x2019;s fun after you&#x2019;ve lived in Bradford 19 years.</dd>
