        <p>So I had this <abbr title="Key Skills for Computing Professionals">KSCP</abbr> coursework. It was mostly multiple-choice, based on content from the course text with a couple of fun questions at the end. And by fun I mean more than five possible answers.</p>

<p>The first one asks: <q>Briefly, describe a topic from the book which you found interesting.</q>
        </p>

<p>My response to this was as follows; [the book being Computer Confluence (concise fifth edition) by George Beekman]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The book wrongly claims: <q>The emerging international standard double-byte character set called Unicode<ins>&#x2026;</ins>
              <del> is designed to facilitate multilingual computing</del>
            </q>. My piece is on an encoding of Unicode which, unlike the one described in the book, exists<ins> (UTF-16 uses two bytes per character, except when it doesn&#x2019;t)</ins>.</p>

<p>UTF-8, 8-bit Unicode Transformation Format (the most commonly used Unicode encoding), uses a variable number of bytes per character depending on the code point being depicted. One byte is used for code points in the range of U+0000 to U+007F. With one-byte characters, UTF-8 is identical to US-ASCII. UTF-8 characters may have from one to four bytes depending on their position in Unicode. One advantage of using UTF-8 is that it can represent characters in a way that&#x2019;s backwards compatible with US-ASCII using one byte per character but also represent any other character in Unicode. This is a large advantage in authoring texts which mostly use characters in Basic Latin (the section of Unicode which is equivalent to US-ASCII), such as English, French, Esperanto. However, in texts requiring more and higher code points (i.e. in Chinese or Japanese text) UTF-8 can produce larger files than other encodings such as UTF-16 or UTF-32.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I completely neglected <em>how</em> UTF-8 works, but the question was only worth three marks so neh.</p>

<p>I then go on to discover that one of the multiple choice questions is wrong (post submission, unfortunately):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Unicode coding system can provide how many different representations?</p>
<ul>
<li>2</li>
<li>4</li>
<li>16</li>
<li>256</li>
<li>about 65,000</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought 65,000 was a little low but it&#x2019;s the only one that makes the slightest bit of sense (it&#x2019;s also the answer the book gives) so I go ahead and circle the fifth answer.</p>

<p>Later on in the day, inspired by the recent spate of UTF-related swoting (mostly on the Wikipedia article <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>) I was reading an article called <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/26/UTF">UTF</a> (on the subject of UTF, strangely) by Sun-folk Tim Bray in which a few particular sentences caught my attention: [emphasis mine]</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/04/26/UTF">
<p>Unicode currently defines just under <strong>100,000</strong> characters, but has space for <strong>1,114,112</strong> code points. They are organised into 17 <q>planes</q> of 2<sup>16</sup> (<strong>65,536</strong>) characters, numbered 0 through 16.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there are <strong>100,000</strong> characters at the moment, with a possibility of <strong>1,114,112</strong> and <strong>65,536</strong> characters in each plane. So the actual answer is <strong>1,114,112</strong>.</p>

<p>The moral of this story is that you should never trust what you read. Ever.</p>
