        <p>Bit late, as usual. But look at me using all those ISO country/language codes!</p>

<dl>
<dt>FQ1: What&#x2019;s your native language? Do you speak any foreign languages? If so, how did you come to learn them?</dt>
<dd>
<p>My first language is English (en-GB). I learnt French and German a bit but I forgot it all.</p>
<p>My second language is <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> (sgn-GB). I learnt it at Bradford College about two years ago and I still remember a fair bit. I&#x2019;d been wanting to learn it for much longer though. It&#x2019;s also the reason I am careful when I use the term <q>foreign language</q> because it is neither my first language nor is it foreign.</p>
<p>My third language is Esperanto (eo), which is also not a foreign language, since it is an international language and not of or belonging to any region.</p>
<p>I expect Italian (it) shall be my fourth language. I shall be learning it over the Summer vacation at the same time as John, then we&#x2019;ll come back and talk to each other in Italian.</p>
</dd>

<dt>FQ2: What&#x2019;s your native country? Have you visited any foreign countries? If so, which ones?</dt>
<dd>Born in England (GB) and I have lived here for all 19 of my years. I have visited: Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland (all GB), Ireland (IE), France (FR), Germany (DE), United States of America (US).</dd>

<dt>FQ3: Are there any foreign foods, books, movies, or other items that you are particularly fond of? Name some of your favorites.</dt>
<dd>
<p>As a resident of Bradford (damn, no region-code for that one) I am treated to excellent availability of central/southern Asian (I need to research what to call that part of Asia) cuisine and I am rather fond of it. I enjoy eastern Asian cuisine too. That&#x2019;s where tofu comes from. Did you know that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> got me into natto?</p>
<p>As far as books go, I&#x2019;ve read Sophie&#x2019;s World (the English translation).</p>
<p>I am fond of many foreign films, I&#x2019;ve seen a lot. I&#x2019;m not sure much beats Am&#xE9;lie or End of Evangelion.</p>
<p>I also like gender-neutral pronouns. Such as ri in Riismo in Esperanto or h&#xE4;n/se in Finnish.</p>
</dd>

<dt>FQ NATIVE: If you had to trade your nationality for that of any foreign country, which would you choose and why?</dt>
<dd>Mu. However I can imagine moving to another country semi-permanently. That would be fun. Hell, anything&#x2019;s fun after you&#x2019;ve lived in Bradford 19 years.</dd>
