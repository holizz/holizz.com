        <p>Tonight when we went to the pool room there were these two horrible townies in there.</p>

<p>One of them (I can&#x2019;t differentiate between the two) asked if he could play me. I said <q>maybe not</q>. While I was sticking the balls in the triangle they asked about my septum piercing. Then they asked if I had a job. Then they asked what job I wanted eventually, I said <q>programmer of some description</q>, they asked how I&#x2019;d get a job with my septum piercing I said <q>they can take me as I am &#x2026; or not</q>.</p>

<p>Later on they complained at me because I came in and put loads of money down when they were just about to play. I think I was quite good at having no sympathy at all for them and showing it. I had an <q>ah well, should have put your money on the table</q> attitude. They also whined because they wanted to play the winner.</p>

<p>Then Jenny mentioned that they usually go before we get there and they said something about their bedtime, insulted our social life (by asking if we go to the Blue Boar every Thursday, if we go to nightclubs, etc.; which Cat handled all on her own), and left.</p>
