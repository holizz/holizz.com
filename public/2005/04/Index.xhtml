        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Tonight when we went to the pool room there were these two horrible townies in there.</p>

<p>One of them (I can&#x2019;t differentiate between the two) asked if he could play me. I said <q>maybe not</q>. While I was sticking the balls in the triangle they asked about my septum piercing. Then they asked if I had a job. Then they asked what job I wanted eventually, I said <q>programmer of some description</q>, they asked how I&#x2019;d get a job with my septum piercing I said <q>they can take me as I am &#x2026; or not</q>.</p>

<p>Later on they complained at me because I came in and put loads of money down when they were just about to play. I think I was quite good at having no sympathy at all for them and showing it. I had an <q>ah well, should have put your money on the table</q> attitude. They also whined because they wanted to play the winner.</p>

<p>Then Jenny mentioned that they usually go before we get there and they said something about their bedtime, insulted our social life (by asking if we go to the Blue Boar every Thursday, if we go to nightclubs, etc.; which Cat handled all on her own), and left.</p>

        <p>It started at Rios, like most Saturday mornings. I spent much more time dancing than I usually do. I danced to almost every song in the goth room until I started to get tired.</p>
<p>I did lots of things I&#x2019;ve been meaning to do for a while today.</p>

<ol>
<li>First of all I shifted my curtains round to one side so I could get lots of sunlight after deciding it was the best source of vitamin D.</li>
<li>Then I did something with the yellow split-peas Sammy gave me: I stuck them in a pan with cashew nuts and made dhal.</li>
<li>Then I played Metroid Prime for the first time in months. I started a new game and played up till the first save to get re-acquainted with the controls. I expect I&#x2019;ll play from where I left off later on, maybe tomorrow.</li>
<li>I had laundry day! For the first time in, well, too long.</li>
<li>I read the <a href="http://relaxng.org/tutorial-20011203.html">RELAX NG Tutorial</a>. It looks very interesting but I&#x2019;m left wondering how one would go about associating a document with a schema for validation.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#x2019;s been an excellent day. I&#x2019;m not sure why but I&#x2019;m in a <em>fantastic</em> mood.</p>

          <a href="/2005/04/05/accesskeys-hate-and-disable">Accesskeys: how I hate them and how I disable them</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Today I was directed to a nice page on the W3C&#x2019;s site: <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html">List of valid DTDs you can use in your document</a>. Since I <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/04/05/ratpoison">recently switched to ratpoison</a>, I have my display laid out with Firefox taking up the bottom half thus I removed the bookmarks toolbar thus I access the bookmarks menu with alt-b. I wanted to alt-b to the bookmarks menu so I could activate my <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> bookmarklet. This is a problem when a Web page defines accesskeys because they override the ability to access menus from the keyboard. There&#x2019;s no issue of me not being able to access links from the keyboard as I have <a href="http://users.tkk.fi/~psillanp/hah_hp/">Hit-a-Hint</a> installed (i.e. I hold the space bar and type a combination of letters to <q>click</q> a link).</p>

<p>From a Web designer&#x2019;s point of view I have decided that accesskeys are good for accessibility in some cases (i.e. users who don&#x2019;t have Hit-a-Hint or similar installed and don&#x2019;t mind having their keys overridden) but I will not implement them until the vast majority of browsers can turn them off easily (i.e. until Firefox adds an option in the Preferences dialog to disable them).</p>

<p>Here&#x2019;s an interesting article on accesskeys and how they hurt accessibility: <a href="http://www.rakaz.nl/nucleus/item/8/catid/4">Leave my keys alone!</a>
        </p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve worked out how to disable accesskeys: go into about:config (i.e. type about:config into the address bar) and set <code>ui.key.generalAccessKey</code> to <code>0</code> (i.e. right-click it &gt; Modify &gt; set it to 0). That disables accesskeys in documents but still allows you to access the menus (you can disable the menu by doing the same thing to <code>ui.key.menuAccessKey</code>).</p>

        <p>Right now I am using <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">Ratpoison</a>. It&#x2019;s a window manager. There are no pretty decorations, no wavy-cool menus popping up everywhere. But it&#x2019;s special, and do you know why?</p>

<p>Because&#x2026;</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/">
<p>It is largely modelled after GNU Screen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read that sentence and I knew I wanted it.</p>

<p>
          <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">Screen</a> is the best thing since, well&#x2026; computers. I don&#x2019;t know how I survived before I discovered screen. My first two commands upon logging into X are <code>xterm -e screen</code> and <code>xterm -e screen -x</code>.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m writing this entry in vim in screen in an xterm in ratpoison in X11. Sometimes it gets a little confusing navigating all my different things. Spending a long time in screen (like I do every day) sometimes makes me use C-A in Firefox to switch tabs, which doesn&#x2019;t work (there should be a screen-alike extension for Firefox). It can get tedious when I&#x2019;m sshed to another host using screen there inside my screen here, which have the same control character because I&#x2019;m too lazy to change it there.</p>

<p>Don&#x2019;t forget to check out the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/keyboards/">pictures of supported hardware</a> (i.e. pictures of keyboards people use with ratpoison). I especially like the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/keyboards/009-edi/">datahand</a> and the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/ratpoison/keyboards/003-rcyeske/">modified Dvorak Happy Hacking keyboard</a>.</p>

        <p>I woke up and thought <q>I didn&#x2019;t set my alarm, what time is it?</q>. Somehow it was 07:30 (half an hour before I was planning on waking up), so I set my alarm for 08:00. Seems like I woke up, turned it off, and went back to sleep because I woke up three minutes before my first lecture when Will texted me to see if I was going. Needless to say, I am not; I am here journalling.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m very sorry, it was 12 days since my last post and lots of things have happened. Well, not that many. But some important things.</p>

<ul>
<li>I started using the Dvorak layout Wednesday (I think) last week and I&#x2019;m still using it. It&#x2019;s a great layout.</li>

<li>Star Wars: Revelations was released yesterday; <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/04/18/0022200">Star Wars: Revelations Available Online</a>. It was rather fantastic.</li>

        <p>I just went to Cult TV. I do love it so.</p>

<p>David leant me End of Evangelion <em>and</em> Death and Rebirth, which I shall probably watch tomorrow. Thank you, David.</p>

<p>Next Monday I shall sign some things which will automagically mean I&#x2019;m on the exec of Cult TV next year. Hooray! I shall take the position of Webmaster, which means I get to feel geeky <em>and</em> superior.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s plug Cult TV a bit:</p>

<li>
            <a href="http://culttv.proboards25.com/">Cult TV message board</a>
          </li>
</ul>

<p>Today, instead of doing homework, I started writing an expert system &#x2026; in Lisp. Should be finished soon.</p>

<p>This post I shall also introduce you to a new feature of this site: my <a href="/Holizz/Currently">Currently</a> thingamibob. It&#x2019;s another thing I chose not to clutter my homepage with. Partially inspired by <a href="http://robespiere.blogspot.com/">Owen</a>&#x2019;s currently reading list.</p>

<p>How odd.</p>

<p>I only watch actual TV (with the tele- part) if I&#x2019;m babysitting. I watch 6 hours of TV (without the tele- part&#x2014;i.e. the visuals come from a DVD and aren&#x2019;t televised) a week at Cult TV.</p>

<p>I never read newspapers as I can get the exact same news online, not that the news newspapers carry is that interesting anyway.</p>

<p>I tend to have a book I read for an hour or so before I go to sleep (it varies depending on how good it is, how tired I am, etc.) and I&#x2019;m currently reading a comic (Preacher) and listening to a podcast-only novel (Earth Core). So maybe 2 hours of novels a day.</p>

<p>I tend to watch one or two films a month.</p>

<p>And pretty much every waking moment when I&#x2019;m at home I am on my computer, which is always connected so I probably spend approximately 12 hours a day online when I have an average amount of social and academic activities.</p>

<p>In other news I did my Formal Foundations coursework relating to finite automata. Typeset in XHTML with PNG diagrams and a weeny bit of CSS (what&#x203D; You didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d even attempt a table in LaTeX, did you?).</p>
