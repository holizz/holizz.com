        <p>Well, sort of. They&#x2019;re basically the recipe for vegan pancakes but with less water. Jen suggested the idea. They&#x2019;re rather delicious&#x2026; apart from the fact that they make me feel like I&#x2019;m about to have a heart attack.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Okay, so <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/03/19/love-it-when">that book</a> was quite useless in that it didn&#x2019;t seem to have much in the way of syntax. I just ordered <cite>
            <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html">ANSI Common Lisp</a>
          </cite> from Amazon. I like CLISP but I&#x2019;m frustrated by the lack of a single &#x201C;this is CLISP and this is how you do it&#x201D; resource on the Web. From what I&#x2019;ve read of the free (as in beer) chapters this book is that resource; yet it&#x2019;s not on the Web for some reason.</p>

<p>Speaking of documentation, of all the languages I&#x2019;ve used <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> is the best for documentation both in terms of tutorials (<a href="http://python.org/doc/2.3.5/tut/tut.html">Python Tutorial</a>) and in self-documentation (<a href="http://python.org/doc/2.3.5/tut/node6.html#SECTION006760000000000000000">Documentation Strings</a>). After using Python for a good few months I thought I&#x2019;d do something in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>; I missed my doc strings and easy access to the innards of objects sorely.</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/">IKEA</a> with Davina tonight. Great fun. But afterwards we went to <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/">Borders</a>. So. Many. Books. Really, there was a <em>huge</em> selection of books compared to any of the book shops or libraries in the centre of Bradford (at least in the only important sections&#x2014;sci-fi and computing). As I wandered past the two shelves of &#x201C;this is how to use this GUI application&#x201D; books I noticed something very rare and very special: a Python book. No two Python books, no three! I was in heaven. Not that I use Python much these days, but if a book shop or library has Python books you know it&#x2019;s a good shop. I also saw a book called Fuzzy Logic, Eric Meyer on CSS, More Eric Meyer on CSS, XML Pocket Reference, CSS Pocket Reference. I almost started hyperventilating at one point.</p>

<p>Is Bradford too illiterate to deserve a book shop like that? (Probably). The biggest we have is a medium-sized Waterstones. But wherever-the-hell-that-was has a <em>huge</em> Borders and I think Leeds city centre has several very big book shops.</p>

<p>My trip to the book shop reminded me that I need to get some good sci-fi soon. Like <cite>I, Robot</cite>. The problem there is that I&#x2019;d have to make the effort to go to the central library and look for it (since it&#x2019;s not in the university library); and even then it may not be there. Even if I did have the inclination to buy it I wouldn&#x2019;t buy a Will Smith-covered copy of the book (which is the only copies most book shops seem to be selling lately). I&#x2019;m sure Will Smith is lovely but as cover art for a book he has no relation to he&#x2019;s very inappropriate (since the film was based on ideas in I, Robot and not on the book itself).</p>
