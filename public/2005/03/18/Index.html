<p>Thank you, Deb!</p>

<p>By the way, I removed my RSS 1.0 feed. There&#x2019;s still <a href="/Index.atom">Atom</a> and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/holizz">RSS 2.0</a> (via <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a>).</p>

          <a href="/2005/03/18/the-trip-to-leeds">The trip to Leeds</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>I went to the IWT lab test at 12:00. It didn&#x2019;t happen because blackboard (that lovely magic bullet) didn&#x2019;t like everybody logging on at once. So I demonstrated my site to the lecturer&#x2019;s assistants. It didn&#x2019;t work in IE (probably because it treated the file as XHTML and thus went haywire and killed itself) and there was an error message which mentioned the DOCTYPE, this prompted the assistant to ask me why I was linking to that page (that page being the DTD for XHTML 1.1). So the assistant didn&#x2019;t recognise the DOCTYPE&#x2026; And then he tried to use Exceed to log into linux1. And it took me 10 minutes to convince him that linux1 doesn&#x2019;t have access to /home/cwsubmit yet the machines in the lab <em>do</em> (I&#x2019;m not sure he knew the difference between using Exceed to log into linux1 from Windows and actually booting the machines into Linux). Then I finally got it marked.</p>

<p>Then I run off to the Interchange and meet Summer (13:00). We go to Leeds. We spent a good while finding <a href="http://thewendyhouse.org/">the Wendy House</a>. But we found it. We even bought tickets. Then off to the Grand Arcade to dine at Roots and Fruits. Mmm. After that we went to one of the Chinese shops. I bought fried soybean curd (mmm), lychees (mmm), and natto (&#x203C;). Then we went to the Adult Store (or whatever it was called) and looked at the pretty PVC clothes. Then the wholefood shop by the Grand Arcade (I didn&#x2019;t buy anything). Then back down to Grin where we bought nothing but we saw Kyra working there. Then home to Bradford.</p>

<p>When I got home (can you guess what happens next?) I ate natto. It&#x2019;s quite odd-tasting. I tried the mustard that comes with it (ick), then the other random sauce (mmm). The other sauce tasted very nice with it. Mmmmmm. So I now love natto.</p>

<p>Thank you, the W3C for <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/idn-and-iri/">introducing me to natto</a> (trust me to discover a new food in a technical article).</p>
