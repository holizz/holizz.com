        <p>I&#x2019;ve been playing games all day. I felt kind of empty up until when I went and made tea.</p>

<p>I went into the kitchen to decide on what to eat and I caught myself snacking while pretending to choose what to eat (pretending to myself, that is) and I was reminded of my theory that goes like thus: if I continue to eat as I&#x2019;m doing now I will gain weight. And a new question was raised: if I can gain weight, do I want to gain weight?</p>

<p>As I was chatting away to myself while running around carrying ingredients, I thought that some people must think I&#x2019;m crazy sometimes.</p>

<p>Right now I&#x2019;m getting kind of <abbr title="Body Dysmorphic Disorder">BDD</abbr> about my figure and posture. Well, maybe not quite that extreme. I decided I look pregnant.</p>

<p>I need more exercise. I also think I&#x2019;m in danger of acquiring a bad posture from leaning over to type. Anybody in the general vicinity of Bradford interested in learning a martial art? I need self-defence and exercise.</p>

<p>Three things I want to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Esperanto</li>
<li>Lip reading</li>
<li>First aid</li>
</ul>

<p>They all involve effort of a social nature. The best way to learn Esperanto would be to find somebody else who wanted to learn it and learn it with them (but I have a hard time convincing people that there&#x2019;s a point to learning it let alone finding people who would be willing to learn it). The best way to learn lip reading would either be a course or just practising by looking at people&#x2019;s lips. First aid would probably be some kind of course. I guess I have to wait till September for courses.</p>

<p>I also want to carry on learning Lisp. But bah, I was playing games all day.</p>

<p>Now I&#x2019;m probably going to eat and play more <a href="http://wesnoth.org/">Wesnoth</a>.</p>
