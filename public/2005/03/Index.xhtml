<p>I rule. But I could rule more, evidently.</p>

<p>Good fun, but on the last page of the test it asked me my date of birth and I had to enable ECMAScript to let it populate the select boxes. It seems like a pointless thing when one could achieve the same result by just writing the data into the select boxes when the page is generated.</p>

<p>Interesting idea: create a toolkit for the Web which abstracts the matter of XHTML to higher-level widgets the same way a normal GUI toolkit abstracts drawing windows to widgets like buttons and labels. It could be a fun idea; I may try implementing it later (possibly in XSLT).</p>

<p>If, by odd chance, you ever read this, Matt: die. And do it fucking quietly. And stop writing your name as &#x201C;m@t&#x201D; on your cereal because that gets pronounced &#x201C;Mat-t&#x201D; and it makes you look like a fucking moron.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>But it&#x2019;s okay, I survived the McDonalds milkshake thrown at me from a moving car.</p>

<p>They came down Great Horton Road and slowed to turn off down the road opposite to the entrance to the university when I was assaulted. They drove off and I wasn&#x2019;t happy. I thought &#x201C;if they come back I shall get their registration number&#x201D;. Luckily they were as predictable as they were idiotic and came back to gloat about their handiwork by laughing at me which is when I got their registration number.</p>

<p>I told Davina on the way home from the Blue Boar and she asked if I wanted to report it so we went to the police station at midnight and reported the idiot.</p>

<p>The car was <code>FH03 TXX</code> if you want to avenge me but I&#x2019;m not too bothered. I was shocked that somebody could hate my coat so much that they&#x2019;d throw animal product at me but I don&#x2019;t care too much for exacting revenge. Well I&#x2019;m assuming they didn&#x2019;t like my coat because it&#x2019;s the most visible thing from a distance at the back and it&#x2019;s the only one of the two things I get the most comments about that&#x2019;s visible from the back (the other is my septum piercing). I don&#x2019;t know of anybody who hates me for a good reason but there are people who don&#x2019;t like me for better reasons than them not liking my clothes or my piercings or my sexuality. Like <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/02/07/djs-phil-and-emma">DJs Phil and Emma</a>.</p>

<p>I considered creating a hate-speech side-blog but then I realised it would be very boring to write or read as I get the same comments mostly.</p>

<p>I just went to the toilet. I pulled my trousers down and the bead from the ring in my prince albert dropped into the toilet. So I put my hand in and got it out. What fun!</p>

<p>Why did you rip open my pack of burger buns spilling them all over the freezer? And why did you rip up some of my bread (leaving it in the packet) and put the pack on the window sill?</p>

<p>I have my suspicions about who it could be (i.e. a certain somebody who likes to throw pasta at the windows and be <a href="/2005/03/02/i-swear-down">overly loud</a>) and I may mention these suspicions when I report this on Monday depending on my mood at the time.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Yesterday was rather eventful. I started off as usual, reading blogs and eating breakfast. I did an absolutely terrible piece of coursework and handed it in with Will who had made more of an effort. It was a case of either saying &#x201C;fuck it&#x201D; and having done with it or doing it all day and getting very few more marks than I will get anyway.</p>

<p>Then we went to the book sale where I got <cite>XML in a Nutshell</cite> (mmm, cheap O&#x2019;Reilly books). We went to town and I asked about <cite>Mind Hacks</cite> in Waterstones; vastly more expensive than at Amazon. We wondered around town a little more and I showed Will where the Market Tavern is then Will got some playing cards from W. H. Smith.</p>

<p>I missed SDTD by completing my coursework (&#x2026; badly) and when we returned from town we&#x2019;d missed SDP. So I went home and then went to Davina&#x2019;s.</p>

<p>On the way to South Square from babysitting I was calling Davina (looking down at my phone) and I walked into a sign post telling me the hours I could park there. It was a square one so I have a small linear bruise on my left wrist, I also have a painful left big toe-nail and I hit my left nipple with the other side of my arm.</p>

<p>After South Square Davina took me shopping then home. I took my shopping with me to meet Summer as it was 10 and Summer had just called me. I took a nice picture of <a href="/2005/03/05/summers-new-dress">Summer&#x2019;s new dress</a>.</p>

<p>We went to Rios. Will was 19. Some old pervert kept telling Summer she was gorgeous and some younger perverts were pretending to shag me while I was dancing.</p>

<p>At least that&#x2019;s what it probably sounded like.</p>

        <p>I&#x2019;m not having much luck finding vegan burger recipes. Half of them contain about a hundred ingredients I haven&#x2019;t got and half require a blender.</p>

<p>And I don&#x2019;t feel like pasta + pesto again&#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, that was a big success. I just went into the kitchen and found a load of ingredients and made some burgers.</p>

<p>I call them Bhaji Burgers, or Pakora Pattys (patty is the American word for the circular piece of cooked food in the burger bun).</p>

<p>I pretty much made onion bhajis but with finely-chopped onion and plopped it in the frying pan. Delicious!</p>

<dl>
<dt>Ingredients</dt>

            <ul>
<li>&#xBD; onion, chopped finely</li>
<li>1 chilli</li>
<li>dried oregano</li>
<li>ground coriander</li>
<li>ground cumin</li>
<li>ground turmeric</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>&#xBD; cup of self-raising flour</li>
<li>1 tbsp soy flour</li>
<li>water</li>
</ul>
          </dd>

<dt>Method</dt>
<dd>
            <ol>
<li>Mix all ingredients and add water until it&#x2019;s slightly more solid than onion bhaji mixture</li>
<li>Fry</li>
</ol>
          </dd>
</dl>

<p>And ooh, look, I made a copy of the recipe in <a href="http://donnafales.com/2002/07/28/recipe-schema#">recipe schema</a> (it&#x2019;s an RDF schema for describing recipes): <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/03/13/bhaji-burgers">Bhaji Burgers</a>.

        <p>I submitted my IWT assignment the other day as <a href="/2005/03/11/university-stuff">I mentioned</a>.</p>

<p>So <a href="/2005/03/09/iwt-assignment-one/">here&#x2019;s the main directory</a> of all the stuff.</p>

<p>Soon after the post about <a href="/2005/03/02/a-cms-in-13-lines-of-shell">my 13-line CMS</a> I realised why people don&#x2019;t tend to use BASH for writing CMSes. It was very broken. sed didn&#x2019;t like all the slashes in my XHTML. So I wrote something similar in Ruby: <a href="/2005/03/14/cms.rb">cms.rb</a>, which compiles the files in my assignment. It&#x2019;s about 30 lines. Sorry, no comments. But it&#x2019;s very simple.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Yesterday I tried out a recent nightly build of <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> and needless to say my chrome didn&#x2019;t survive.</p>

<p>
          <img src="/2005/03/16/broken-chrome" alt="A not well-formed XML error inside a Firefox dialog box"/>
        </p>

<p>So I reinstalled all my extensions and themes, imported my <a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/">Adblock</a> list, manually imported my bookmarks, set some random options, and copied my old userContent.css in.</p>

<p>I don&#x2019;t think any of my extensions have changed much. But <a href="http://www.mankin-studio.com/downloads.html">Saferfox Xpanded</a> has been updated. Some things look better, some look worse.</p>

<p>
          <a href="/2005/03/16/saferfox">
            <img src="/2005/03/16/saferfox-detail" alt="The Saferfox Xpanded theme in Firefox"/>
          </a>
        </p>

<p>My main gripe with the new Saferfox is that it has a little button saying <q>RSS</q> where it used to have a non-textual icon. Maybe it&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m not fond of RSS right now (<a href="/2005/03/16/problem-with-rss-1">I&#x2019;ll expand on that later</a>) but really, do they not know that Atom exists?</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>(All this blogging lately, maybe I should call this a blurnal or a jourlog or some amusing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteu">portmanteau</a>.)</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve been fiddling with a few options (i.e. the options found in <a href="about:config">about:config</a>) in <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> today as I had to <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/03/16/firefox-chrome">re-chrome it earlier</a>. You know, tweak the accept-string (<code>network.http.accept.default</code>) so that it prefers XHTML over XML and XML over HTML, etc.. While I was doing that I came across a couple of options and I wondered what they did.</p>

<p>So I tested them. Turns out they effect <abbr title="Internationalised Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr>s (see <cite>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/idn-and-iri/">An Introduction to Multilingual Web Addresses</a>
          </cite>).</p>

<p>So I figure I&#x2019;d tell you how to enable IRIs in Firefox.</p>

<p>But first, an explanation of what IRIs are:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
            <abbr title="Internationalised Domain Name">IDN</abbr>
          </dt>
<dd>Allows Unicode in domain names (i.e. caf&#xE9;.example.com).</dd>

<dt>
            <abbr title="Internationalised Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr>
          </dt>
<dd>A <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> with Unicode in it. I.e. in the domain name, in the path, etc. (http://caf&#xE9;.example.com/ is an IRI and so is http://example.com/caf&#xE9;/).</dd>
</dl>

<p>Yes, I know that sucked but it was just a simple introduction. Anne <a href="http://annevankesteren.nl/archives/2005/02/iri" title="IRI">explains it better</a>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
            <code>network.enableIDN</code>
          </dt>
<dd>This is <code>false</code> by default in the official 1.0.1, I believe. Set it to <code>true</code> to allow IDNs.</dd>

<dt>
            <code>network.IDN_show_punycode</code>
          </dt>
<dd>If this is <code>true</code> an IDN is displayed in Unicode (caf&#xE9;.example.com), if not it displays IDNs in a scary way (xn&#x2013;0trv4xfvn8el34t.w3.mag.keio.ac.jp &#x2026; not the same domain name).</dd>

<dt>
            <code>network.standard-url.encode-utf8</code>
          </dt>
<dd>If this is <code>false</code> then Unicode in the path of the resource just won&#x2019;t work.</dd>

<dt>
            <code>network.standard-url.escape-utf8</code>
          </dt>
<dd>If this is <code>false</code>, IRIs will be escaped (like so: %E7%B4%8D), if <code>true</code> it will look lovely.</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you&#x2019;re worried about <a href="http://www.shmoo.com/idn/">IDN spoofing</a>, I recommend the <a href="http://4t2.cc/mozilla/idn">IDN Info</a> extension. It sticks a little icon in the address bar when you&#x2019;re looking at an IDN.</p>

<p>Want to test it? The W3C has some <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/tests/#iri">IDN and IRI test pages</a>.</p>

<p>And that&#x2019;s all a Firefox user has to do to get it working. Enjoy your IRIs.</p>

        <h2>
          <a href="/2005/03/16/problem-with-rss-1">The problem with RSS 1.0</a>
        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Okay, the problem isn&#x2019;t with <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/">RSS 1.0</a> itself, it&#x2019;s with the implementation of it.</p>

<p>RSS 1.0 is an RDF syndication format in the middle of a few XML formats (RSS 0.9x, RSS 2.0, Atom). Thus I think implementors got lazy and thought <q>oh, it&#x2019;s just another XML feed</q>. But it&#x2019;s not, it&#x2019;s RDF. And for RDF you&#x2019;re best off using an RDF parser rather than an XML parser because not all RDF is serialised into XML and there are many shortcuts in RDF/XML that can be overlooked (such as <code>rdf:parseType="Literal"</code>).</p>

<p>I think implementors treating RSS 1.0 as XML is the reason my feed doesn&#x2019;t validate in the <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholizz.com%2F2005%2F03%2F16%2Frss1-snapshot">Feed Validator</a>, or the <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholizz.com%2F2005%2F03%2F16%2Frss1-snapshot">RSS Validator</a>. However, it validates fine in the <a href="http://librdf.org/rss?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fholizz.com%2F2005%2F03%2F16%2Frss1-snapshot">Redland RSS 1.0 Validator</a> and it produces lovely N-Triples in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/ARPServlet?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fholizz.com%2F2005%2F03%2F16%2Frss1-snapshot">W3C RDF Validator</a>.</p>

<p>So it&#x2019;s perfectly valid as far as I can tell but so far most RSS validators and readers don&#x2019;t seem to like it. Is there any point in keeping it if nobody can use it? And how can I have more than one version of RSS being served from the same URI (the URI being <a href="/">/</a>) if they all use the same damn MIME type? Whoever had the great idea of <q>I know, I&#x2019;ll call my syndication format RSS <em>too</em>
          </q> should be shot.</p>

<p>I have a few options here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leave it as it is and just warn users that the RSS may not work</li>
<li>Remove my RSS 1.0 feed entirely</li>
<li>Replace it with another RSS format</li>
<li>Merge my RSS 1.0 into my RDF metadata located at / and add another RSS feed</li>
<li>Seek revenge for the mess collectively known as RSS</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#x2019;ll have a think about it.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>I went to the IWT lab test at 12:00. It didn&#x2019;t happen because blackboard (that lovely magic bullet) didn&#x2019;t like everybody logging on at once. So I demonstrated my site to the lecturer&#x2019;s assistants. It didn&#x2019;t work in IE (probably because it treated the file as XHTML and thus went haywire and killed itself) and there was an error message which mentioned the DOCTYPE, this prompted the assistant to ask me why I was linking to that page (that page being the DTD for XHTML 1.1). So the assistant didn&#x2019;t recognise the DOCTYPE&#x2026; And then he tried to use Exceed to log into linux1. And it took me 10 minutes to convince him that linux1 doesn&#x2019;t have access to /home/cwsubmit yet the machines in the lab <em>do</em> (I&#x2019;m not sure he knew the difference between using Exceed to log into linux1 from Windows and actually booting the machines into Linux). Then I finally got it marked.</p>

<p>Then I run off to the Interchange and meet Summer (13:00). We go to Leeds. We spent a good while finding <a href="http://thewendyhouse.org/">the Wendy House</a>. But we found it. We even bought tickets. Then off to the Grand Arcade to dine at Roots and Fruits. Mmm. After that we went to one of the Chinese shops. I bought fried soybean curd (mmm), lychees (mmm), and natto (&#x203C;). Then we went to the Adult Store (or whatever it was called) and looked at the pretty PVC clothes. Then the wholefood shop by the Grand Arcade (I didn&#x2019;t buy anything). Then back down to Grin where we bought nothing but we saw Kyra working there. Then home to Bradford.</p>

<p>When I got home (can you guess what happens next?) I ate natto. It&#x2019;s quite odd-tasting. I tried the mustard that comes with it (ick), then the other random sauce (mmm). The other sauce tasted very nice with it. Mmmmmm. So I now love natto.</p>

<p>Thank you, the W3C for <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/idn-and-iri/">introducing me to natto</a> (trust me to discover a new food in a technical article).</p>

        <p>On Friday I <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/03/18/the-trip-to-leeds">went to Leeds</a>, as you know. Later on I went to Rios with Summer. Fun as usual. Two guys came up to me and said they really liked my septum piercing (who doesn&#x2019;t?).</p>

<p>Saturday. Well, I&#x2019;m not sure much happened up until I figured I <em>didn&#x2019;t</em> have an hour to get ready (I actually had minus time to get ready). Yes, I am a dork. I ran off to the Interchange to miss the train. But Summer and James/Carney were there. I hadn&#x2019;t missed them, at least. We got the next train to Leeds where we didn&#x2019;t get a bus (because we missed it&#x2014;because of me being a dork and being late) so we got a taxi to Halo and walked the rest of the way.</p>

<p>How can I explain <a href="http://thewendyhouse.org/">The Wendy House</a>? Well, it was fantastic. It takes part in the Stylus and Bar Coda clubs in Leeds University Union (which is an underground labyrinth). I have no idea where the time went. I had fun with Summer and James and Charis and Semra and then the fire alarm was going off. It was almost the end so I just went down to get my coat and Summer&#x2019;s bag and Summer and James were already down there. Lots of photos were taken with random people (I&#x2019;ll upload the photos for all to see some time soon) then we went outside and said goodbye and we left. We walked back to the train station (taking photos on the way) and called a taxi.</p>

<p>Today I did lots of exciting things too. I went to South Square Caf&#xE9; and Sheffield&#x2019;s Millennium Galleries with Davina then we came home (my home, not hers) and I cooked for her (it&#x2019;s her birthday). Mmm, that mango explosion cake was so good.</p>

<p>In case you ever wanted to know what I eat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>22:51 &lt;holizz&gt; Mmm, I ate lots today</p>
<p>22:52 &lt;holizz&gt; Including bhaji burgers, pasta, mango explosion cake, potato wedges, a small salad, dhal soup with a roll, an apricot slice. Uhm. Breakfast cereal.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>I&#x2019;ve been playing games all day. I felt kind of empty up until when I went and made tea.</p>

<p>I went into the kitchen to decide on what to eat and I caught myself snacking while pretending to choose what to eat (pretending to myself, that is) and I was reminded of my theory that goes like thus: if I continue to eat as I&#x2019;m doing now I will gain weight. And a new question was raised: if I can gain weight, do I want to gain weight?</p>

<p>As I was chatting away to myself while running around carrying ingredients, I thought that some people must think I&#x2019;m crazy sometimes.</p>

<p>Right now I&#x2019;m getting kind of <abbr title="Body Dysmorphic Disorder">BDD</abbr> about my figure and posture. Well, maybe not quite that extreme. I decided I look pregnant.</p>

<p>I need more exercise. I also think I&#x2019;m in danger of acquiring a bad posture from leaning over to type. Anybody in the general vicinity of Bradford interested in learning a martial art? I need self-defence and exercise.</p>

<p>Three things I want to learn:</p>

<ul>
<li>Esperanto</li>
<li>Lip reading</li>
<li>First aid</li>
</ul>

<p>They all involve effort of a social nature. The best way to learn Esperanto would be to find somebody else who wanted to learn it and learn it with them (but I have a hard time convincing people that there&#x2019;s a point to learning it let alone finding people who would be willing to learn it). The best way to learn lip reading would either be a course or just practising by looking at people&#x2019;s lips. First aid would probably be some kind of course. I guess I have to wait till September for courses.</p>

<p>I also want to carry on learning Lisp. But bah, I was playing games all day.</p>

<p>Now I&#x2019;m probably going to eat and play more <a href="http://wesnoth.org/">Wesnoth</a>.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Okay, so <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/03/19/love-it-when">that book</a> was quite useless in that it didn&#x2019;t seem to have much in the way of syntax. I just ordered <cite>
            <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html">ANSI Common Lisp</a>
          </cite> from Amazon. I like CLISP but I&#x2019;m frustrated by the lack of a single &#x201C;this is CLISP and this is how you do it&#x201D; resource on the Web. From what I&#x2019;ve read of the free (as in beer) chapters this book is that resource; yet it&#x2019;s not on the Web for some reason.</p>

<p>Speaking of documentation, of all the languages I&#x2019;ve used <a href="http://python.org/">Python</a> is the best for documentation both in terms of tutorials (<a href="http://python.org/doc/2.3.5/tut/tut.html">Python Tutorial</a>) and in self-documentation (<a href="http://python.org/doc/2.3.5/tut/node6.html#SECTION006760000000000000000">Documentation Strings</a>). After using Python for a good few months I thought I&#x2019;d do something in <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>; I missed my doc strings and easy access to the innards of objects sorely.</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/">IKEA</a> with Davina tonight. Great fun. But afterwards we went to <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/">Borders</a>. So. Many. Books. Really, there was a <em>huge</em> selection of books compared to any of the book shops or libraries in the centre of Bradford (at least in the only important sections&#x2014;sci-fi and computing). As I wandered past the two shelves of &#x201C;this is how to use this GUI application&#x201D; books I noticed something very rare and very special: a Python book. No two Python books, no three! I was in heaven. Not that I use Python much these days, but if a book shop or library has Python books you know it&#x2019;s a good shop. I also saw a book called Fuzzy Logic, Eric Meyer on CSS, More Eric Meyer on CSS, XML Pocket Reference, CSS Pocket Reference. I almost started hyperventilating at one point.</p>

<p>Is Bradford too illiterate to deserve a book shop like that? (Probably). The biggest we have is a medium-sized Waterstones. But wherever-the-hell-that-was has a <em>huge</em> Borders and I think Leeds city centre has several very big book shops.</p>

<p>My trip to the book shop reminded me that I need to get some good sci-fi soon. Like <cite>I, Robot</cite>. The problem there is that I&#x2019;d have to make the effort to go to the central library and look for it (since it&#x2019;s not in the university library); and even then it may not be there. Even if I did have the inclination to buy it I wouldn&#x2019;t buy a Will Smith-covered copy of the book (which is the only copies most book shops seem to be selling lately). I&#x2019;m sure Will Smith is lovely but as cover art for a book he has no relation to he&#x2019;s very inappropriate (since the film was based on ideas in I, Robot and not on the book itself).</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.amanita.net/100things.php">Meredith&#x2019;s 100 things</a>, I&#x2019;m writing a 100 things of my own (yes, I&#x2019;m a big copycat).</p>

<ol>
<li>My full name is Thomas Malcolm John Adams.</li>
<li>I was born on 1986-02-19.</li>
<li>My greatest passion is computing.</li>
<li>I sometimes think I must seem very odd or eccentric to some people.</li>
<li>I have never known my height or weight for longer than the time for it to pass in one ear and out the other.</li>
<li>I started going to <a href="http://www.bradfordrio.com/">Rios</a> in late 2002 and am still going (2005-06).</li>
<li>I have no sexual orientation as I am attracted to <em>people</em>, not their sex or gender.</li>
<li>I took a City and Guilds in C programming (level 2) when I was 14 (? TODO) in 2000 (? TODO) and had to initially pay the tuition fees with my own money until my school reembersed me (as free evening classes at Bradford College are only free if you&#x2019;re at least 16, apparently).</li>
<li>I love to cook.</li>
<li>I love to learn.</li>
<li>I took a course in <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> in 2002 and failed while being one of the better signers on the course. I still love BSL and would like to start learning and using it again.</li>
<li>I enjoy body modification.</li>
<li>I have been using GNU/Linux on my computer exclusively since several hours before getting my nipples pierced on 2003-10-&#x2047; (TODO).</li>
<li>I don&#x2019;t like it when others seem to think I&#x2019;m not an artist just because I&#x2019;m a computer scientist.</li>
<li>I have been vegan since the Summer of 2004 and vegetarian for almost as long as I can remember.</li>
<li>I learnt a small amount of Esperanto in the Summer of 2004 and I want to continue learning it (yet it will be hard because there are no courses).</li>
<li>I have not intentionally taken any recreational or psychoactive drugs since several weeks after my 18th birthday in 2004.</li>
<li>I find describing people as <q>a vegan</q> (for example) as opposed to <q>vegan</q> slightly offensive as it seems to imply that they are <em>just</em> a vegan, rather than veganity being an attribute of them. Expressed in XML:
<dl>
<dt>
                <q>a vegan</q>
              </dt>
<dd>
                <code>&lt;vegan name="Holizz"/&gt; &lt;!-- Holizz is a vegan &#x2013;&gt;</code>
              </dd>
<dt>
                <q>vegan</q>
              </dt>
<dd>
                <code>&lt;person name="Holizz" vegan="vegan"/&gt; &lt;!-- Holizz is a person who is vegan &#x2013;&gt;</code>
              </dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>I love to try new food.</li>
<li>I dislike phrases where one word has more than one meaning. e.g. <code>/* TODO */</code>.</li>
<li>I &#x2665; Unicode (that was U+2665 BLACK HEART SUIT, in case you missed it).</li>
<li>
            <code>&lt;i love="xml"&gt;</code>
          </li>
<li>I can&#x2019;t stand incorrect punctuation (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lmg/7997611/in/set-69593/">like so</a>), it makes me queasy.</li>
<li>I like reading the homepages of random people on university web sites.</li>
<li>I love libraries and book sales, but mostly book sales because you never know what great stuff you&#x2019;ll find.</li>

        <p>This morning I wondered how much cream I had left in a little carton so I poured it into my hand. Then I ate <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/03/23/i-made-donuts">donuts</a> with coconut cream. They&#x2019;re actually not bad, I guess they just tasted a little too greasy when they were fresh out of the deep fat.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>I went to Wetherspoons with Will to meet Summer and Suze (who I haven&#x2019;t seen in almost a year). Then we came back to Will&#x2019;s and watched an hour of Family Guy. I tried his dress on, it looked good but it was too tight around the chest and waist for me to take deep breaths. He said I could have had it if fitted. He&#x2019;s so sweet.</p>

<p>I need a dress.</p>

<p>I am currently listening to <cite>Enya</cite>&#x2019;s <cite>Watermark</cite> album. It&#x2019;s very relaxing and melodic.</p>

<p>I was reading <a href="http://del.icio.us/meredith">Meredith&#x2019;s del.icio.us</a> today and I found these <a href="http://seabed.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/wallpaper.tmpl?issue_id=20050301">National Graphic wallpapers</a> (change the month in the URI to get other wallpapers). </p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve been getting into <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> lately. It&#x2019;s great fun. I have the feeds of several tags in my feed-reader (<a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a> at the moment) such as <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/vegan">vegan</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/lisp">lisp</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/unicode">unicode</a>. It&#x2019;s fantabulous. I&#x2019;ve been finding several great things every day.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;ve also been contributing links, not just reading them. Here&#x2019;s <a href="http://del.icio.us/holizz">my del.icio.us links</a>.</p>

<p>Just before I go, I found something that looks <em>very</em> good, via <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/rdf">del.icio.us/tag/rdf</a>: <a href="http://vocab.org/relationship/">RELATIONSHIP: A vocabulary for describing relationships between people</a>. Just looking at it, I think it could be very useful (i.e. fun). I expect I&#x2019;ll do that tomorrow.</p>
