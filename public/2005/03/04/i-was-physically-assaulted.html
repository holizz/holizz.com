        <p>But it&#x2019;s okay, I survived the McDonalds milkshake thrown at me from a moving car.</p>

<p>They came down Great Horton Road and slowed to turn off down the road opposite to the entrance to the university when I was assaulted. They drove off and I wasn&#x2019;t happy. I thought &#x201C;if they come back I shall get their registration number&#x201D;. Luckily they were as predictable as they were idiotic and came back to gloat about their handiwork by laughing at me which is when I got their registration number.</p>

<p>I told Davina on the way home from the Blue Boar and she asked if I wanted to report it so we went to the police station at midnight and reported the idiot.</p>

<p>The car was <code>FH03 TXX</code> if you want to avenge me but I&#x2019;m not too bothered. I was shocked that somebody could hate my coat so much that they&#x2019;d throw animal product at me but I don&#x2019;t care too much for exacting revenge. Well I&#x2019;m assuming they didn&#x2019;t like my coat because it&#x2019;s the most visible thing from a distance at the back and it&#x2019;s the only one of the two things I get the most comments about that&#x2019;s visible from the back (the other is my septum piercing). I don&#x2019;t know of anybody who hates me for a good reason but there are people who don&#x2019;t like me for better reasons than them not liking my clothes or my piercings or my sexuality. Like <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/02/07/djs-phil-and-emma">DJs Phil and Emma</a>.</p>

<p>I considered creating a hate-speech side-blog but then I realised it would be very boring to write or read as I get the same comments mostly.</p>
