        <p>On Friday I <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/03/18/the-trip-to-leeds">went to Leeds</a>, as you know. Later on I went to Rios with Summer. Fun as usual. Two guys came up to me and said they really liked my septum piercing (who doesn&#x2019;t?).</p>

<p>Saturday. Well, I&#x2019;m not sure much happened up until I figured I <em>didn&#x2019;t</em> have an hour to get ready (I actually had minus time to get ready). Yes, I am a dork. I ran off to the Interchange to miss the train. But Summer and James/Carney were there. I hadn&#x2019;t missed them, at least. We got the next train to Leeds where we didn&#x2019;t get a bus (because we missed it&#x2014;because of me being a dork and being late) so we got a taxi to Halo and walked the rest of the way.</p>

<p>How can I explain <a href="http://thewendyhouse.org/">The Wendy House</a>? Well, it was fantastic. It takes part in the Stylus and Bar Coda clubs in Leeds University Union (which is an underground labyrinth). I have no idea where the time went. I had fun with Summer and James and Charis and Semra and then the fire alarm was going off. It was almost the end so I just went down to get my coat and Summer&#x2019;s bag and Summer and James were already down there. Lots of photos were taken with random people (I&#x2019;ll upload the photos for all to see some time soon) then we went outside and said goodbye and we left. We walked back to the train station (taking photos on the way) and called a taxi.</p>

<p>Today I did lots of exciting things too. I went to South Square Caf&#xE9; and Sheffield&#x2019;s Millennium Galleries with Davina then we came home (my home, not hers) and I cooked for her (it&#x2019;s her birthday). Mmm, that mango explosion cake was so good.</p>

<p>In case you ever wanted to know what I eat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>22:51 &lt;holizz&gt; Mmm, I ate lots today</p>
<p>22:52 &lt;holizz&gt; Including bhaji burgers, pasta, mango explosion cake, potato wedges, a small salad, dhal soup with a roll, an apricot slice. Uhm. Breakfast cereal.</p>
