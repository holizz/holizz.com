Notes:
- This site was tested in Firefox which means it should look reasonably good in any modern CSS browser (i.e. it may look terrible in IE).

- It was written assuming the server it's running on is using content negotiation thus a hyperlink may point to ``Me'' and the resource that should be returned is ``Me.xhtml'', for example. So it probably won't work if you're testing it locally.

- This project is also available [1]on my Web site just incase you're not testing this on a server with content negotiation.
