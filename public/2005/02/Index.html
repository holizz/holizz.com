        <p>Yes, I did <a href="http://www.blogography.com/fridayq.html">Friday Q</a> on Saturday (heresy!). But then I forgot about it.</p>

<p>I just watched Team America&#x2014;World Police with Stuart, Niall, Mike, Laura, and Phil. I remembered all their names, I rule. It was pretty amusing.</p>

<p>I almost felt as if I&#x2019;d stepped onto the tips of the hairs of the rabbit being pulled from the hat of the universe, staring into the eyes of the illusionist just now when I thought of how I was last night. I was just concentrating on getting to sleep as soon as possible so I could sleep off the nightmare. I even put myself in the recovery position before I fell asleep (or as close as memory serves).</p>

<p>There&#x2019;s nothing like a nightmarish experience to make one happy to be alive and <em>sober</em>.</p>

<p>Today I went to Introduction to Web Technologies. It was rather boring. Then it was Software Development (Programming) in the same room, that was boring too. Then I went home and slept, thus missing Formal Foundations, which I hear is good. About strings, they say. I hear exciting things will be taught. Then I slept again till just before the film, then I watched the film and came home. Now I shall leave you with my mostly-complete Friday Q&#x2026; from Saturday.</p>

<strong>FQ TOPIC: Tip.</strong>

<p>It&#x2019;s Friday Q&#x2026; but I&#x2019;m doing it on a Saturday. Please don&#x2019;t eat me.</p>

<strong>FQ1: Share a health or beauty tip!</strong>

<p>Eat well. Listen to your body. Drugs are a last resort.</p>

<strong>FQ2: Share a computer or electronic gadget tip!</strong>

<strong>FQ3: Share a travel or transportation tip!</strong>

<p>Always keep paper and a pen near by. Or equivalent. I keep my notepad and a pen with me all the time. You never know when you might come up with a great idea to implement later in code.</p>

<strong>FQ TIPSTER: Got a tip for a classic or vintage CD, movie, TV show, or book we might have overlooked?</strong>

<p>Isaac Asimov&#x2019;s Foundation series. But they&#x2019;re at the end of the Foundation universe. I&#x2019;m planning on reading them <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_Series#List_of_books" title="The Foundation Series#List of books">in order</a>.</p>

        <p>Right. Last URI change.</p>

<p>If you are reading this from <a href="http://holizz.com/">holizz.com</a> you may already realise that I have a new domain. And if you&#x2019;re not, then go to <a href="http://holizz.com/">holizz.com</a> and see how ultimately cool it is.</p>

<p>I also have a new URI for <em>me</em>, as well as for my blog. The URI for me is <a href="http://holizz.com/Holizz/">http://holizz.com/Holizz/</a>, which allows one to write nice triplets about me, such as:</p>

<p>
          <code>&lt;http://holizz.com/Holizz/&gt; &lt;#is&gt; &lt;#gay&gt;.</code>
        </p>

<p>Okay, so maybe I cheated a little. I&#x2019;ll look up &#x2018;is&#x2019; and &#x2018;gay&#x2019; in <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> one day.</p>

<p>And with my new URIs comes a new CMS (not to forget the new TLA). It&#x2019;s based on the original Sunc databases but this one&#x2019;s in Ruby and it generates a static archive.</p>

<p>It generates everything with <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">REXML</a> therefore if my markup is bad XHTML then it excepts and I have to correct it, which is good. Since it generates a static archive rather than serves a dynamic one, it can take longer in its algorithms. Thus it won&#x2019;t strain the server if I want to implement a complex algorithm. Also, it&#x2019;s been made in such a way that it should be reasonably effortless to make it output in RSS or RDF later on.</p>

<p>So far it only generates the individual pages and the main index page; no yearly, monthly, or daily indeces.</p>

<p>But yes, new domain, new hosting, new URIs. How better could life get? Lectures tomorrow start at 1pm. Woop.</p>

        <p>Okay, so maybe Introduction to Web Technologies today wasn&#x2019;t that bad. It was mostly covering the basics of HTTP and mentioning some other related protocols.</p>

<p>But Formal Foundations (currently Computer Theory), I rather enjoyed that. <a href="http://www.comp.brad.ac.uk/contact/contact.php/staff/p/acsenki">Attila Csenki</a> (the lecturer) was talking about <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">regular expressions</a>. But this wasn&#x2019;t the basics like <code>(?:xyz){6,9}(?=&gt;012)</code>, it was an introduction to the theory behind it.</p>

<p>In regular expressions one could say that <code>a*</code> means that it matches 0 or more <code>a</code>s in a row. But no, Csenki told us that the <em>closure</em> of <code>a</code> was the set</p>

<p>{&#x39B;, a, aa, aaa, aaaa, aaaaa, &#x2026;}</p>

<p>(&#x39B; referring to a string of zero length, or <code>""</code> in most languages).</p>

<p>He seems to be an intelligent person, but I&#x2019;m not sure he&#x2019;s too good at teaching first-year idiots who get bored easily and start talking. I like him. He has a pocket watch. All the coolest people have pocket watches. So, uh&#x2026; That&#x2019;s Csenki and <a href="http://robespiere.blogspot.com/">Owen</a>.</p>

<p>Now some randomly-assembled gobbledegook:</p>

<ul>
<li>Davina was driving me home one night and we saw a lot of flashing blue lights by Bombay Stores. I told her Neil would blog about it. And <a href="http://www.neilturner.me.uk/2005/Feb/02/car_crash.html" title="Car Crash">he did</a>.</li>

<p>It&#x2019;s that time of the week again: Saturday. Thus I shall now do the <a href="http://www.blogography.com/fridayq.html">Friday Q</a>.</p>

<p>FQ TOPIC: Sleepy.</p>

<p>FQ1: On average, how many hours of sleep do you get each night? Do you think that&#x2019;s a good number?</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m not sure. But going back to uni after the long holidays has fucked my sleeping up. I keep going to bed late and then failing to wake up.</p>

<p>On Friday I woke up at 0840 when I wanted to wake up at 0800 thus I only had 1.33 hours to get ready and get to KSCP thus I spent almost zero minutes on my computer and zero minutes doing what I usually do when I wake up (reading blogs mainly) and then I only had two hours for lunch thus I only had a short time to do things thus I was Internet-deprived until I got home at about 2200 thus I had an almost depressed day. Internet-deprivation is a terrible thing.</p>

<p>FQ2: Have you any sleep essentials? A nightlight or teddy bear perhaps? Must the door and closet be either closed or open?</p>

<p>My door is closed and locked as I live in halls. My door was closed at my mum&#x2019;s because of the noise at night (mum going to bed) and in the morning (kids).</p>

<p>So no, not really.</p>

<p>FQ3: What do you wear to bed? What color are your sheets? How many pillows under your head?</p>

<p>I wear nothing to bed, my douvet cover and pillow case (at the moment) are white with colourful swirly things and my matress cover thingy is blue with lovely stains thanks to nature&#x2019;s distain at my lack of masturbation.</p>

<p>FQ BIG SLEEP: Share some helpful advice you use when having trouble falling asleep.</p>

<p>I usually just keep trying. Occasionally I&#x2019;ll get pissed off after doing that for several hours and do something like read some more book until I start being more sleepy.</p>

        <p>I&#x2019;ve had four URIs for blogs/journals in the past. There is, of course <a href="http://holizz.com/">http://holizz.com/</a>. Some of you may remember <a href="http://holizz.niallfleming.ath.cx/">http://holizz.niallfleming.ath.cx/</a> (which redirects here because I redirected /year/month/etc. and I couldn&#x2019;t be bothered spending a while getting / to leave it be&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s okay, all the content from there is here).</p>

<p>But before that, what was there? Of course! <a href="http://holizz.blogspot.com/">http://holizz.blogspot.com/</a>! That lasted from 2004-08-09 till 2005-01-11 when it was obsoleted by http://holizz.niallfleming.ath.cx/. That wasn&#x2019;t too long now, was it? Only 70 entries.</p>

<p>And before that? Does anybody remember?</p>

<p>Why <a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/~holizz/">http://www.deadjournal.com/~holizz/</a>, of course! That lasted from 2002-11-17 till 2003-10-27. I eventually got bored of it and left it in the capable hands of Summer (because deadjournal is invitation-only). So I&#x2019;ve been blogging (back in my day it was called a journal ;) for two years and three months!</p>

<p>And what brought this nostalgia on, you ask? Why I&#x2019;m doing my <a href="http://www.leatheregg.com/bloggercode/">Blogger Code</a>.</p>

<p>I think I need to create a Web crawler to trawl deadjournal and blogger to get all my entries back. Then I can stick them into my current CMS and have an archive spanning over two years of my life. I think it would be a good idea. It may or may not be easier to simply mirror each site so that the bot doesn&#x2019;t take hours to run.</p>

<p>And my Blogger Code is&#x2026;</p>

        <p>If, Space-forbid, you are unfamiliar with DJs Phil and Emma: they DJ on a Wednesday night at Bradford Rio. Then often play terrible music. I often request S-Club 7 as it&#x2019;s better than a lot of the shit they play.</p>

<p>I was in the Courtyard bar in the Communal Building with Niall, Wendy, Mike, and Amanda. Stuart had just left. And what does Amanda say? I don&#x2019;t know; I didn&#x2019;t quite hear. &#x201C;Did you just say you knew the Wednesday night DJ at Rios?&#x201D; I inquire. As it turns out her boyfriend shares an abode with DJ Phil and Emma.</p>

<p>She then went on to mention somebody who always requests S-Club 7 on a Wednesday. Wow. Phil/Emma has noticed me. Summer was mentioned too. Apparently they want to slap us.</p>

<p>I only joked about it before. But we really <em>are</em> the celebrities of Rios.</p>

<p>The other Friday DJ Simon pushed Summer and stood on my foot, which either means he&#x2019;s very clumsy or he hates us. So maybe everybody <em>does</em> hate us. I do hope so.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, we got the results for KSCP1 (the formal report&#x2014;ours was called The Internet: Beyond the Porn). Our group (consisting of myself, Stuart, Will and John) got 14/20, not bad. I&#x2019;ll upload a copy once I decide on a URI for it.</p>

        <p>I was meant to go to the IWT (Introduction to Web Technologies) but I set my alarm thinking it was Thursday so I woke up just as the lab started and the following lab was in an hour so I didn&#x2019;t bother with either.</p>

<p>In IWT we were meant to be comparing search engines in &#x201C;relevancy of results, and ease of use&#x201D; (according to Niall).</p>

<p>So anyway I had some breakfast and lunch then I went to town to see Summer. We had fun and she bought lots of pink stuff to wear to Kulu. It shall be fun. It was also decided that I should dye my hair purple before we go to the <a href="http://www.thewendyhouse.org/">Wendy House</a> on my birthday.</p>

<p>So we come back to my room. We have a chat and eat toast (Summer didn&#x2019;t like my peanut butter). What awaits me in my inbox? Why it&#x2019;s an email from the fellow who did the <a href="http://www.ivor.it/goog/">Google and MSN search comparison</a> which showed that MSN Search gives more results for IIS-based servers than Google Search does.</p>

<p>It would appear that <a href="http://www.ivor.it/">Ivor</a> saw hits coming from <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/01/27/google-and-msn-search" title="Google and MSN Search">my article on Google/MSN search</a> (or so one would expect) and compiled some results for <a href="http://www.ivor.it/goog/big1000/holizz.html">holizz</a> and <a href="http://www.ivor.it/goog/big1000/Tom+Adams.html">Tom+Adams</a>.</p>

<p>I expect the vast amount of Apache for &#x201C;holizz&#x201D; is due to the fact that I tend to use geek sites. And I was impressed to see that <a href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a> already has holizz.com as number one. That was the first time I&#x2019;ve used Teoma. Really.</p>

<p>So thank you very much Ivor.</p>

        <p>I believe IE is being given <code>application/rdf+xml</code> when it visits my home page (or so I&#x2019;ve been told) because it&#x2019;s a moron. For that, I apologise. As far as I can tell only IE is stupid enough to fetch RDF instead of something more useful.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m not sure I can change the behaviour since I can only edit <code>.htaccess</code>.</p>

<p>I tried</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
            <code>AddType text/html .html; qs=0.9<br />
AddType application/xhtml+xml .xhtml; qs=0.8<br />
AddType application/rdf+xml .rdf; qs=0.7</code>
          </p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/xhtml-mimetype/content-negotiation" title="Content-Negotiation Techniques to serve XHTML 1.0 as text/html and application/xhtml+xml">see also</a>) but it doesn&#x2019;t seem to work when using</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
            <code>HEAD / HTTP/1.1<br />
Host: holizz.com<br />
Connection: close<br />
<br />
</code>
          </p>
</blockquote>

<p>as it just gives me <code>application/rdf+xml</code>. Maybe IE would work with it. Maybe not.</p>

<p>Getting rid of <code>Index.rdf</code> isn&#x2019;t really an option as I want RDF-capable agents to be fed RDF if they choose.</p>

<p>If IE is badly-behaved and I can&#x2019;t make it behave well, I will not lose sleep. Just readers. But ah well.</p>

<p>Next up: a new style.</p>

<p>Yes, look at my lovely stylesheet. I was going to go for a sea theme, but the sky looked better than the sea in the <a href="http://www.confusticate.com/photos/gallery.php/photos/Cruise2004/Day5/Images/15.jpg?path=/photos/Cruise2004/Day5">photo I used</a>. I found it via <a href="http://search.creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons Search</a>.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s surprisingly hard to find nice graphics to use. And no, I am not an 1337 GIMPerz so I can&#x2019;t make my own.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;ll notice, the <code>div#header</code> element has been instructed <code>overflow: auto</code> to stop it from overflowing and making the rest of the page unreadable if it&#x2019;s scrolled up. You may also notice that the font is 120% (well over the 100% the <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/font-size" title="Care With Font Size">W3C advises</a>) thus facilitating readability. For the same end there is no junk like a <a href="/About/Copyright">copyright statement</a> and <a href="/About/Blogroll">blogroll</a> to clutter up the pages.</p>

<p>An finally: my email address.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, my <a href="/Holizz/Contact">contact page</a> includes my incomplete email address for spam concerns. I had a thought which involved embedding the agent&#x2019;s IP address in the address (since I get email to all at this domain). Thus it would give <code>mailto:127.0.0.1@<var>this_domain</var>
          </code> (I&#x2019;m still not brave enough), for example. And each person or harvester would get a different address. Humans and machines well-versed in English will be informed that they can just email <code>holizz@&#x2026;</code> if they prefer.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m not sure about the idea though as I don&#x2019;t know if it would be very useful in practice. It would allow me to give real URIs out (which is nice) yet it could just result in a lot of spam to a lot of different email addresses.</p>

Fridays are the worst though, five hours of lectures then I usually go to Thornton to babysit (but not this week) then I usually go out to Rios (it&#x2019;s Kulu this week &#x2026; which finishes at 6am. No I will not be staying till the end).</p>

<p>Notepad is a minimal GUI text editor. How the <em>hell</em> can it be compared to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs">Emacs</a>, possibly one of the most powerful text editors on the planet (if not the Universe)? I&#x2019;m not a zealot, mind you. I haven&#x2019;t used Emacs for a long time. I use <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, which may not be as powerful but is the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/xstatic/pressreleases/10122004">most popular</a> editor according to that press release.</p>

<p>I have nothing against people promoting editing with a text editor (I had a friend who couldn&#x2019;t understand why I used Notepad rather than Word for plain text stuff). But come on, how can I, a Vim user, support a cause with the namesake of a Microsoft product? It&#x2019;s like having an operating system Web ring called &#x201C;Windows Webring&#x201D;. How about the &#x201C;Text Editor Webring&#x201D; for a slightly less product-dependant name?</p>

<p>While searching for a button proclaiming something to the effect of &#x201C;created with XML parser&#x201D;, I came across an amusing post on a random board: <a href="http://www.xtreeme.com/forum/archive/o_t__t_390__generated-menus-not-xhtml-compliant.html">Generated menus not XHTML compliant!</a>.</p>

<li>So on Friday at around 9pm I met Summer and Carney at the Exchange. A little while later we got a taxi to <a href="http://kulu.info/">Kulu</a>, which opened at 10pm. Kulu was good, we stayed till the end (6am) and then got a taxi home. It was a very good night. I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d stay till the end because 8 hours is generally too much for me. But it was good fun.</li>

<li>I was watching UKTV Discovery +1 last night on somebody else&#x2019;s Sky (I was babysitting in Thornton). It was a show about accidents regarding various space-travel&#x2013;related missions. At some point they blamed a particular accident (i.e. three people burning to death while testing a thing with pure oxygen in it and exposed wiring) on &#x201C;engineers who didn&#x2019;t think things through or management&#x201D;. Where the hell were the testers? Surely an engineer would have thought &#x201C;putting people in a pure oxygen environment &#x2026; there&#x2019;s a problem with this plan&#x201D; but if they didn&#x2019;t, good testing would have shown that the thing is likely to combust and thus is not safe.</li>

<li>Since I was babysitting in Thornton till 0am-ish I slept at Davina&#x2019;s. I found a &#x201C;we have your post&#x201D; card hanging out of the letter box saying that they&#x2019;d left it in the fucking recycling bin! How stupid can you get? What if Davina&#x2019;d been away and a neighbour put the bin out for her?</li>

<li>
            <a href="http://www.rednova.com/news/display/?id=126649">Can This Black Box See Into the Future?</a> As much as I&#x2019;d love to believe in the Gaia theory, I can&#x2019;t. This is simply reading too much into the results. The results may be significant by any arbitrary level of significance but unless this machine predicts world events at a fixed interval before the event occurs I will not take any notice of it. It&#x2019;s like the &#x201C;psychic&#x201D; (read: scammer) who tells people to find an old watch that doesn&#x2019;t work and hold it in their hands and they will make it work. For most people it will not work but for some the warmth of their hands will cause the watch to tick for a little while longer. These people will then phone in to the show and everybody will believe the scammer. If they were really psychic they would be rich (due to the huge reward offered to anybody whose psychic powers can be empirically proven) and wouldn&#x2019;t need to go on stupid talk shows to make a little money.</li>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>I&#x2019;m 19 today. As with my last two birthdays and various pseudo-important events, the date clicked over while at Rios. Dancing to a song I like.</p>

<p>It was an enjoyable night. I was dancing for most of it. With my lovely friend Summer.</p>

<p>After Summer left at around 1am an odd fellow from Seattle sat next to me and talked absolute shit to me in his horrible accent. The topic ranged from the &#x201C;booger&#x201D; I have in my nose to his Chevy (the stupid American prick) to his interest in Summer&#x2019;s arse. He actually used the phrase &#x201C;Life&#x2019;s a bitch&#x201D; and in his horrible accent it was very hard to keep myself from laughing in his face.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re out there, prick from Seattle with a Chevy, hello!</p>

<p>So what exciting things have I done today? I opened some presents and made breakfast and lunch. Nothing magical.</p>

<p>But surely you have some exciting thing to do tonight, o great Holizz&#x203D;</p>

<p>I was going to The Wendy House but that didn&#x2019;t work out. I&#x2019;ll probably just read <a href="urn:isbn:0-596-00263-7">Practical RDF</a> (it&#x2019;s one of my presents from Davina) and try and make my CMS generate indices. I may even cook something nice.</p>

<p>I was quite surprised to get &#xA3;20 of book tokens from South Square Centre. That was nice of them.</p>

<p>And for those who are wondering, <code>urn:isbn:0-596-00263-7</code> is a perfectly valid URI, it&#x2019;s just that most browsers don&#x2019;t do anything with it. Yet.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Comparatively speaking, of course. But it sucks compared to most days I&#x2019;ve had recently. I expect it&#x2019;s because I was excited about it (not that I&#x2019;d shown it&#x2014;in fact I tried to keep it hidden from myself).</p>

<p>Last birthday began at Rios, just like this birthday. But last year I went to see Damien Rice and two days after my birthday I had a party thrown for me. It was very exciting.</p>

<p>The birthday before that also began at Rios. But that birthday I was fucked on ecstasy and I stayed up all night with <var>friend a</var> and <var>friend b</var> sitting on my bed talking and then in the morning David, Mandy, Rebecca and Tory came round and we had lunch at South Square Caf&#xE9; and all the time I was thinking &#x201C;I&#x2019;m so fucked and I can&#x2019;t tell them&#x201D;. It was very exciting.</p>

<p>This birthday was, of course, welcomed in while dancing at Rios. But the difference is that I have nothing else planned for today or any time soon. Sure I opened nice presents but nothing <em>happened</em>. It was just a let down. Somewhere in my mind was saying &#x201C;oh this is going to be so fun&#x203C;&#x201D; but a more wizened and conscious area was saying &#x201C;on no it fucking won&#x2019;t&#x201D;.</p>

<p>So this year I&#x2019;m not seeing musicians, partying or taking recreational drugs. I&#x2019;m sitting at home eating burnt rice/soup with under-cooked potatoes.</p>

<p>I suppose the day hasn&#x2019;t ended up badly, at least. I read <cite>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/">XHTML 1.1 - Module-based XHTML</a>

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>This entry contains an open letter of sorts to my biological father.</p>

<h3>The story that forced me to act</h3>

<p>I heard an interesting story over lunch today, which prompted me to act regarding a particular matter (the action in question takes place in this entry). The story goes as follows (names not mentioned to preserve anonymity):</p>

<p>
          <var>Person</var>&#x2019;s dad called her and told her how proud he was of her. Then she told him he couldn&#x2019;t be proud of her because he hadn&#x2019;t been part of her life at all. And then she told him she didn&#x2019;t want anything to do with him at all.</p>

<h3>A little context</h3>

<p>My response to hearing this story was that I was far too polite to do anything like that. Too polite or too socially anxious? Both, I think.</p>

<p>My dad called me yesterday. He asked me if I had a blog. I stupidly said yes and went on to give him the URI to it.</p>

<p>I have decided that it is important to deal with this problem now. Self-respect has overridden politeness (as it should). Although it pains my politeness to do so, I will now deal with the problem. Publically. On my journal.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;m counting on my biological father reading this as I don&#x2019;t have his email address and I don&#x2019;t plan on calling him. By the way, this takes the form of an &#x201C;open letter&#x201D; (although I hate to call it that) because I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to say this.</p>

<h3>README</h3>

<p>Hi, biological father. I have had contact with you only for the tiniest percentage of my life. As a result I know very little of you (for example, I don&#x2019;t even know your middle name(s)). The little contact I have had with you has been negative; I dread communicating with you. In short, <em>I hate you</em>. I do not want you in my life at all.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re interested in my life enough to be reading this, why not tell me you&#x2019;ve read it so I have a little conclusion on the whole matter. My email address is on my <a href="/Holizz/Contact">contact</a> page. I wouldn&#x2019;t bother calling because my telephone skills are worse than my speaking face-to-face skills. Not that you&#x2019;d know that.</p>

<h3>Afterward</h3>

<p>I never wanted to have to say it but I&#x2019;m not sorry for saying it.</p>

<p>I thought I&#x2019;d elaborate on what I meant by negative contact (for the benefit of my readers). So here are some examples of my experience with my biological father:</p>

<ul>
<li>My earliest memory of him is him flicking my ear as punishment. I don&#x2019;t know how old I was at the time but Davina has never physically harmed me as punishment so this came as a big shock to me.</li>
<li>My most recent negative contact was when I was forced (thank you, Davina) to spend a week at his house; it was the second-to-last week of the six-week holidays before I started my A-Levels. I think this can be called the worst experience of my life.
	<ul>
	<li>He made me chop 20 (maybe less, I don&#x2019;t recall) planks of wood before he&#x2019;d give me lunch. My skills have never lied in physical strength so after a long time I managed chopped one and asked for lunch. He said no so I went back outside and cried.</li>
	<li>I helped him do things during the week (such as fit guttering, help him roof his shed&#x2014;he lives on a farm and is a farmer as far as I can tell) and I don&#x2019;t recall him thanking me.</li>
	<li>He let me access the Internet once in the entire week. For about 20 minutes. And he watched me do it. After Sue, Emma and Adam went to some random thing part way through the week (yes, for the last few days I and he were alone in the house) he lied that they must have taken the modem cable with them. He later told Davina that he&#x2019;d done that because I hadn&#x2019;t done enough work throughout the week. I think I did a lot of work compared to the amount of physical labour I usually do. Note that this was a time in my life when I spent a <em>lot</em> of time on the Internet and that the Internet was my <em>only</em> socialisation medium.</li>
	</ul>
I kept a diary when I was at his house. I imagined him finding it while I was there and him getting angry and me stabbing him in self-defence.
</li>
</ul>

<p>I call him my biological father as to call him &#x201C;dad&#x201D; would conjure ideas of family. I used to call him my &#x201C;genetic contributor&#x201D;, which is actually a better term than &#x201C;biological father&#x201D;. I suppose it&#x2019;s just easier to say biological father.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>After getting my <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/02/21/now-with-rss-1-0">RSS 1.0 feed</a> working it was trivial to make my <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php">Atom</a> feed <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholizz.com%2FIndex.atom">validate</a>.</p>

<p>The XSLT parser kept putting the XHTML namespace in the root element which the validator didn&#x2019;t like. It was a simple matter of skimming the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">specification</a> until I found what I wanted: <code>xsl:exclude-result-prefixes="xhtml"</code> in the <code>xsl:stylesheet</code> element.</p>

<p>So as with the RSS 1.0, the Atom feed is available <a href="/">here</a> and if your user agent doesn&#x2019;t request a content-type, you can get it <a href="/Index.atom">here</a>.</p>

<p>I was having trouble generating a <code>tag:</code> URI with plain XSLT so I looked around for an <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/28/howto-atom-id" title="How to make a good ID in Atom">Atom ID HOWTO</a> but then I found <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/28/LinksAndGuids">an interesting article</a> which mentions that <code>tag:</code> isn&#x2019;t a registered schema and argues that if your URIs don&#x2019;t change anyway then there&#x2019;s no need for a <code>tag:</code> URI. As a result my <code>atom:id</code> element contains the same URI as <code>atom:link@atom:href</code> (mmm, pseudo XPath) does.</p>

        <div class="meta">

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>So I finally got round to making my RSS 1.0 feed validate.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s available <a href="/">here</a> if your user-agent requests <code>application/rss+xml</code> or <a href="/Index.rss">here</a> if it doesn&#x2019;t.</p>

<p>It even validates. In fact I had it available for a while before it did. Turns out I just had my <code>item</code> elements inside the <code>channel</code>. It took a good while before I worked it out though because none of the RSS validators told me; they just made obscure complaints.</p>

<ul>
<li>
            <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholizz.com%2FIndex.rss">Feed Validator</a>
          </li>
<li>
            <a href="http://rss.scripting.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fholizz.com%2FIndex.rss">RSS Validator</a>. This one said it was valid even when the other two disagreed.</li>
<li>
            <a href="http://librdf.org/rss?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fholizz.com%2FIndex.rss">Redland RSS 1.0 Validator and Viewer</a>. This was the most useful because it gave useful information I could use to debug it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I chose RSS 1.0 (RDF Site Summary in this case) because I quite like RDF at the moment. It troubles me not in the least that there are all these incompatible RSS specifications floating about as I neither use RSS (or any kind of syndication) nor do I write an RSS user agent. I just wanted to increase the ways people can read my site.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s generated using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSLT</a>, no less. I apply a simple stylesheet to <code>Index.xhtml</code>.</p>

<p>Next up: Atom. It shouldn&#x2019;t be too hard, I just have to go off and read <a href="http://www.atomenabled.org/developers/syndication/atom-format-spec.php">the specification</a> and a few examples then I can apply a similar stylesheet.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;d say you should be geeky about whatever field you want a career in. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine going into a career and not being insanely interested in the subject, which is why I was so shocked to hear that somebody on my course applied to the course because computer science graduates get such-and-such a year. I just don&#x2019;t get why you&#x2019;d want to devote a life&#x2019;s studies and work to a subject you&#x2019;re apathetic about.</p>

<p>Just when I thought I couldn&#x2019;t worship them anymore, the <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a> introduced me to a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/idn-and-iri/JP%E7%B4%8D%E8%B1%86/%E5%BC%95%E3%81%8D%E5%89%B2%E3%82%8A%E7%B4%8D%E8%B1%86.html" title="Hikiwari Natto test page">soy-based food</a> (see the <a href="http://w3.org/International/tests/sec-iri-3" title="I18N Tests: Resource identifiers 3">IRI test page</a>).

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Two nights in a row I have visited the fine establishment known as <a href="http://www.bradfordrio.com/">Rios</a>. It was good fun on Friday. Saturday was a little boring.</p>

<p>Some random guy approached me when I was sitting down as if he wanted to shake my hand. I stood up with my hand ready to shake his and he dragged me onto the dance floor. It was quite odd. And socially it was scary. When I&#x2019;m with people in unusual situations (or if I don&#x2019;t know the people I&#x2019;m with) I generally have to think a lot to try and appear less socially inept than I am. I mainly have to think about issues like &#x201C;If I do <var>X</var> will I appear to be <var>Y</var>?&#x201D; where <var>X</var> is any behaviour and <var>Y</var> tends to be something to do with offending them. Because I generally find talking to random strangers difficult I often think along the lines of &#x201C;how can I appear to like this person and not completely offend them by appearing uninterested in them without talking to them&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I, Will and Chris walked some person home after Rios; called Emma, I believe. I said to her &#x201C;I apologise if my sobriety offends you.&#x201D; at some point and Will thought it was amusing so he told me to blog about it. So I am blogging about it. Hi, Will.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344510/">A Very Long Engagement</a> tonight. It was fantastic; I loved it. It was quite sad in parts but it ended well. And the ending wasn&#x2019;t as clich&#xE9;d as it could have been.</p>

        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>So via email the Introduction to Web Technologies lecturer invites me to his room and I reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could but I&#x2019;d prefer to discuss it over email, if you don&#x2019;t mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what does he do? After the IWT lecture he tells me he wants to talk to me in his office and again I remind him I prefer email. He asks me again and I accept, damn it.</p>

<p>So I go to his office. He&#x2019;s talking to somebody else so after a while I knock on the door.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to ask <em>me</em> what I think&#x2019;s wrong with the course or whatever and then complains at me for my email with a flippant analogy (see below quotation).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you encouraging people who may know little about markup and accessibility to do things the wrong way when you should be teaching them to do it the right way? It&#x2019;s like a primary school teacher teaching children to eat glass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it was a little harsh but ah well.</p>

<p>So at some stage I start to feel like I&#x2019;m about to cry. This is why I prefer email, I can&#x2019;t handle face-to-face situations like this; I wasn&#x2019;t sad, it&#x2019;s just what happens. It happens in every situation like that, where I&#x2019;m sitting face-to-face with a teacher of some variety and forced to talk. I don&#x2019;t know why but it just happens.</p>

<p>I tried to make my point, but it didn&#x2019;t work. Then I tried my best to just go &#x201C;um-hmm&#x201D; or &#x201C;okay&#x201D; to everything he said just to get out of there but it didn&#x2019;t work. I had to think quickly about one thing that I thought was wrong with the course, I asked him for a minute to think at which point I started to think. I thought &#x201C;I have to get out of here&#x201D;. I started mumbling about Will being better at this talking stuff and I started babbling about the first problem that came to mind.</p>

<p>Then he made his closing statement, which involved complaining that I hadn&#x2019;t apologised about the email (I thought &#x201C;fuck him, I&#x2019;m not apologising now, I&#x2019;ll do it via email later&#x201D;). And it was over. I left, in tears, said goodbye on the way out and vowed never to do anything like that again.</p>

<p>The point I was failing to make was that for the assignment he&#x2019;s mandating the use of tables for layout when he <em>should</em> be saying &#x201C;do some funky layout shit; I advise you to use tables but do it in CSS or DSSSL or what-the-hell-ever just as long as it looks cool&#x201D;.</p>

<p>He made the point that one day I&#x2019;ll need to have interviews and I can&#x2019;t really do that over email. It&#x2019;s a valid point and I expect I&#x2019;ll have to treat this problem at some point.</p>
