        <p>I was meant to go to the IWT (Introduction to Web Technologies) but I set my alarm thinking it was Thursday so I woke up just as the lab started and the following lab was in an hour so I didn&#x2019;t bother with either.</p>

<p>In IWT we were meant to be comparing search engines in &#x201C;relevancy of results, and ease of use&#x201D; (according to Niall).</p>

<p>So anyway I had some breakfast and lunch then I went to town to see Summer. We had fun and she bought lots of pink stuff to wear to Kulu. It shall be fun. It was also decided that I should dye my hair purple before we go to the <a href="http://www.thewendyhouse.org/">Wendy House</a> on my birthday.</p>

<p>So we come back to my room. We have a chat and eat toast (Summer didn&#x2019;t like my peanut butter). What awaits me in my inbox? Why it&#x2019;s an email from the fellow who did the <a href="http://www.ivor.it/goog/">Google and MSN search comparison</a> which showed that MSN Search gives more results for IIS-based servers than Google Search does.</p>

<p>It would appear that <a href="http://www.ivor.it/">Ivor</a> saw hits coming from <a href="http://holizz.com/2005/01/27/google-and-msn-search" title="Google and MSN Search">my article on Google/MSN search</a> (or so one would expect) and compiled some results for <a href="http://www.ivor.it/goog/big1000/holizz.html">holizz</a> and <a href="http://www.ivor.it/goog/big1000/Tom+Adams.html">Tom+Adams</a>.</p>

<p>I expect the vast amount of Apache for &#x201C;holizz&#x201D; is due to the fact that I tend to use geek sites. And I was impressed to see that <a href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a> already has holizz.com as number one. That was the first time I&#x2019;ve used Teoma. Really.</p>

<p>So thank you very much Ivor.</p>
