        <p>So via email the Introduction to Web Technologies lecturer invites me to his room and I reply:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could but I&#x2019;d prefer to discuss it over email, if you don&#x2019;t mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what does he do? After the IWT lecture he tells me he wants to talk to me in his office and again I remind him I prefer email. He asks me again and I accept, damn it.</p>

<p>So I go to his office. He&#x2019;s talking to somebody else so after a while I knock on the door.</p>

<p>He then proceeds to ask <em>me</em> what I think&#x2019;s wrong with the course or whatever and then complains at me for my email with a flippant analogy (see below quotation).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you encouraging people who may know little about markup and accessibility to do things the wrong way when you should be teaching them to do it the right way? It&#x2019;s like a primary school teacher teaching children to eat glass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe it was a little harsh but ah well.</p>

<p>So at some stage I start to feel like I&#x2019;m about to cry. This is why I prefer email, I can&#x2019;t handle face-to-face situations like this; I wasn&#x2019;t sad, it&#x2019;s just what happens. It happens in every situation like that, where I&#x2019;m sitting face-to-face with a teacher of some variety and forced to talk. I don&#x2019;t know why but it just happens.</p>

<p>I tried to make my point, but it didn&#x2019;t work. Then I tried my best to just go &#x201C;um-hmm&#x201D; or &#x201C;okay&#x201D; to everything he said just to get out of there but it didn&#x2019;t work. I had to think quickly about one thing that I thought was wrong with the course, I asked him for a minute to think at which point I started to think. I thought &#x201C;I have to get out of here&#x201D;. I started mumbling about Will being better at this talking stuff and I started babbling about the first problem that came to mind.</p>

<p>Then he made his closing statement, which involved complaining that I hadn&#x2019;t apologised about the email (I thought &#x201C;fuck him, I&#x2019;m not apologising now, I&#x2019;ll do it via email later&#x201D;). And it was over. I left, in tears, said goodbye on the way out and vowed never to do anything like that again.</p>

<p>The point I was failing to make was that for the assignment he&#x2019;s mandating the use of tables for layout when he <em>should</em> be saying &#x201C;do some funky layout shit; I advise you to use tables but do it in CSS or DSSSL or what-the-hell-ever just as long as it looks cool&#x201D;.</p>

<p>He made the point that one day I&#x2019;ll need to have interviews and I can&#x2019;t really do that over email. It&#x2019;s a valid point and I expect I&#x2019;ll have to treat this problem at some point.</p>
