        <p>Two nights in a row I have visited the fine establishment known as <a href="http://www.bradfordrio.com/">Rios</a>. It was good fun on Friday. Saturday was a little boring.</p>

<p>Some random guy approached me when I was sitting down as if he wanted to shake my hand. I stood up with my hand ready to shake his and he dragged me onto the dance floor. It was quite odd. And socially it was scary. When I&#x2019;m with people in unusual situations (or if I don&#x2019;t know the people I&#x2019;m with) I generally have to think a lot to try and appear less socially inept than I am. I mainly have to think about issues like &#x201C;If I do <var>X</var> will I appear to be <var>Y</var>?&#x201D; where <var>X</var> is any behaviour and <var>Y</var> tends to be something to do with offending them. Because I generally find talking to random strangers difficult I often think along the lines of &#x201C;how can I appear to like this person and not completely offend them by appearing uninterested in them without talking to them&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I, Will and Chris walked some person home after Rios; called Emma, I believe. I said to her &#x201C;I apologise if my sobriety offends you.&#x201D; at some point and Will thought it was amusing so he told me to blog about it. So I am blogging about it. Hi, Will.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344510/">A Very Long Engagement</a> tonight. It was fantastic; I loved it. It was quite sad in parts but it ended well. And the ending wasn&#x2019;t as clich&#xE9;d as it could have been.</p>
