I downloaded <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">1.0.1</a>, enabled IDN and installed <a href="http://4t2.cc/mozilla/idn/" title="Firefox IDN Info">something to alert me when on an IDN domain</a>.</p>

<p>I&#x2019;d say you should be geeky about whatever field you want a career in. I couldn&#x2019;t imagine going into a career and not being insanely interested in the subject, which is why I was so shocked to hear that somebody on my course applied to the course because computer science graduates get such-and-such a year. I just don&#x2019;t get why you&#x2019;d want to devote a life&#x2019;s studies and work to a subject you&#x2019;re apathetic about.</p>

<p>Just when I thought I couldn&#x2019;t worship them anymore, the <a href="http://w3.org/">W3C</a> introduced me to a new <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/articles/idn-and-iri/JP%E7%B4%8D%E8%B1%86/%E5%BC%95%E3%81%8D%E5%89%B2%E3%82%8A%E7%B4%8D%E8%B1%86.html" title="Hikiwari Natto test page">soy-based food</a> (see the <a href="http://w3.org/International/tests/sec-iri-3" title="I18N Tests: Resource identifiers 3">IRI test page</a>). I shall try it at some point (I&#x2019;m thinking the Chinese shops in Leeds are a good place to start&#x2014;they do the lovely frozen tofu too).</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="section entrycontent">
        <p>Two nights in a row I have visited the fine establishment known as <a href="http://www.bradfordrio.com/">Rios</a>. It was good fun on Friday. Saturday was a little boring.</p>

<p>Some random guy approached me when I was sitting down as if he wanted to shake my hand. I stood up with my hand ready to shake his and he dragged me onto the dance floor. It was quite odd. And socially it was scary. When I&#x2019;m with people in unusual situations (or if I don&#x2019;t know the people I&#x2019;m with) I generally have to think a lot to try and appear less socially inept than I am. I mainly have to think about issues like &#x201C;If I do <var>X</var> will I appear to be <var>Y</var>?&#x201D; where <var>X</var> is any behaviour and <var>Y</var> tends to be something to do with offending them. Because I generally find talking to random strangers difficult I often think along the lines of &#x201C;how can I appear to like this person and not completely offend them by appearing uninterested in them without talking to them&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I, Will and Chris walked some person home after Rios; called Emma, I believe. I said to her &#x201C;I apologise if my sobriety offends you.&#x201D; at some point and Will thought it was amusing so he told me to blog about it. So I am blogging about it. Hi, Will.</p>

<p>I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0344510/">A Very Long Engagement</a> tonight. It was fantastic; I loved it. It was quite sad in parts but it ended well. And the ending wasn&#x2019;t as clich&#xE9;d as it could have been.</p>
