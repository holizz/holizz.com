        <p>I&#x2019;m 19 today. As with my last two birthdays and various pseudo-important events, the date clicked over while at Rios. Dancing to a song I like.</p>

<p>It was an enjoyable night. I was dancing for most of it. With my lovely friend Summer.</p>

<p>After Summer left at around 1am an odd fellow from Seattle sat next to me and talked absolute shit to me in his horrible accent. The topic ranged from the &#x201C;booger&#x201D; I have in my nose to his Chevy (the stupid American prick) to his interest in Summer&#x2019;s arse. He actually used the phrase &#x201C;Life&#x2019;s a bitch&#x201D; and in his horrible accent it was very hard to keep myself from laughing in his face.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re out there, prick from Seattle with a Chevy, hello!</p>

<p>So what exciting things have I done today? I opened some presents and made breakfast and lunch. Nothing magical.</p>

<p>But surely you have some exciting thing to do tonight, o great Holizz&#x203D;</p>

<p>I was going to The Wendy House but that didn&#x2019;t work out. I&#x2019;ll probably just read <a href="urn:isbn:0-596-00263-7">Practical RDF</a> (it&#x2019;s one of my presents from Davina) and try and make my CMS generate indices. I may even cook something nice.</p>

<p>I was quite surprised to get &#xA3;20 of book tokens from South Square Centre. That was nice of them.</p>

<p>And for those who are wondering, <code>urn:isbn:0-596-00263-7</code> is a perfectly valid URI, it&#x2019;s just that most browsers don&#x2019;t do anything with it. Yet.</p>
