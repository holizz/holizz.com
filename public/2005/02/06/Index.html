<li>
            <strong>What did you have for breakfast?</strong> I&#x2019;m eating it now. Morrisons&#x2019; Malties with expensive &#x201C;organic&#x201D; soy milk.</li>

<li>
            <strong>Siblings?</strong> Two step.</li>
<li>
            <strong>What was your favourite toy as a child?</strong> Lego.</li>
<li>
            <strong>Summer or Winter?</strong> In seasons, Winter.</li>

            <strong>Chocolate or vanilla?</strong> Chocolate.</li>
<li>
            <strong>Who is most likely to respond?</strong> Like I said, you need to be a little more imaginative. Just because everybody else does it it doesn&#x2019;t mean you have to too. If everybody else jumped off a cliff like lemmings being chased by a BBC camera operator, would you do it too?</li>
<li>
            <strong>Who is least likely to respond?</strong> See one above. If only I could use XPath to refer to the previous answer&#x2026; maybe I can.</li>

<li>
            <strong>Mountains or beach?</strong> I have very little experience of mountains. But the beach is okay.</li>
<li>
            <strong>The current friend you have known the longest?</strong> Summer. Since first school.</li>
<li>
            <strong>Full names of your potential kids?</strong> My potential kids do not have names as they&#x2019;re only potential. Idiot.</li>
<li>
            <strong>Usual bedtime?</strong> It ranges from around 0100 till 0500. It all depends on what I&#x2019;m doing in the evening. Sometimes I have to tear myself away from what I&#x2019;m doing such that I only wake up an hour after my alarm goes off.</li>
