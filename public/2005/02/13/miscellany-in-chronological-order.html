<li>So on Friday at around 9pm I met Summer and Carney at the Exchange. A little while later we got a taxi to <a href="http://kulu.info/">Kulu</a>, which opened at 10pm. Kulu was good, we stayed till the end (6am) and then got a taxi home. It was a very good night. I didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d stay till the end because 8 hours is generally too much for me. But it was good fun.</li>

<li>I was watching UKTV Discovery +1 last night on somebody else&#x2019;s Sky (I was babysitting in Thornton). It was a show about accidents regarding various space-travel&#x2013;related missions. At some point they blamed a particular accident (i.e. three people burning to death while testing a thing with pure oxygen in it and exposed wiring) on &#x201C;engineers who didn&#x2019;t think things through or management&#x201D;. Where the hell were the testers? Surely an engineer would have thought &#x201C;putting people in a pure oxygen environment &#x2026; there&#x2019;s a problem with this plan&#x201D; but if they didn&#x2019;t, good testing would have shown that the thing is likely to combust and thus is not safe.</li>

<li>Since I was babysitting in Thornton till 0am-ish I slept at Davina&#x2019;s. I found a &#x201C;we have your post&#x201D; card hanging out of the letter box saying that they&#x2019;d left it in the fucking recycling bin! How stupid can you get? What if Davina&#x2019;d been away and a neighbour put the bin out for her?</li>

<li>
            <a href="http://www.rednova.com/news/display/?id=126649">Can This Black Box See Into the Future?</a> As much as I&#x2019;d love to believe in the Gaia theory, I can&#x2019;t. This is simply reading too much into the results. The results may be significant by any arbitrary level of significance but unless this machine predicts world events at a fixed interval before the event occurs I will not take any notice of it. It&#x2019;s like the &#x201C;psychic&#x201D; (read: scammer) who tells people to find an old watch that doesn&#x2019;t work and hold it in their hands and they will make it work. For most people it will not work but for some the warmth of their hands will cause the watch to tick for a little while longer. These people will then phone in to the show and everybody will believe the scammer. If they were really psychic they would be rich (due to the huge reward offered to anybody whose psychic powers can be empirically proven) and wouldn&#x2019;t need to go on stupid talk shows to make a little money.</li>
