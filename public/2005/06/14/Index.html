        <p>Today I woke up, had breakfast while watching Daria, read my feeds. Then I did 30 lengths in the pool, went to the last book sale of the academic year and got a second book on Italian. Off home with increased circulation and a new book (that book sale will be my financial downfall) for half an hour of meditation and now yummy lunch.</p>

<p>I went swimming for the first time in ages on Thursday mainly because I felt so atrophied having been sitting here most of the year.</p>

<p>On Friday was my last exam, Formal Foundations. I think I did quite well, it was certainly the better of the three. After the exam I was invited to Biko, where all the other post-exam woes would be discussed. But I had forgotten to submit my <abbr title="Key Skills for Computing Professionals">KSCP</abbr>5 coursework, so I rushed off to the library thinking I could SSH home, copy it to my user space and print it, but I couldn&#x2019;t find an SSH client so I had to run home, make one symlink, then go back and print it. I got it in with minutes to spare (note: I did literally run). At some point that day I handed my form in and paid so I can stay in Longside for a couple of weeks. Later that night I went to Rios with Will and John. It was good fun but that&#x2019;s the last I&#x2019;ll be seeing of John for a good long while as he left for home in Wales the next day.</p>

<p>Saturday I don&#x2019;t think I did much.</p>

<p>Sunday I took some boxes of things I shan&#x2019;t be needing for a while and put them in Davina&#x2019;s studio (so when I move twice in as many weeks we can do it in one carload each time). I also did some photos for Davina (i.e. sticking kids&#x2019; photos in albums which will then be sent to their parents) while watching The Graduate and then Enterprise (which happened to be the last one I watched at Cult TV).</p>

<p>Monday I paid lots of money to the Student Reception.</p>

<p>I have yet to start looking for a Summer job and tell Mr Awan that I would like to move in come the first of July.</p>

<p>In terms of Lisp, I&#x2019;m still wondering what I&#x2019;m missing to make all attempts at getting either <a href="http://portableaserve.sourceforge.net/">Portable AllegroServe</a> or <a href="http://www.cliki.net/Araneida">Araneida</a> to work fail (yes, I was reading the tutorials). I&#x2019;ve also had no luck at using any other slightly complex Common Lisp package, like <a href="http://www.cliki.net/CLIM">CLIM</a>. I keep getting all sorts of errors about packages not being made, name collisions, and scary things I can&#x2019;t fix.</p>

<p>Also, I want to be able to compile Common Lisp to <abbr title="Executable and Linkable Format">ELF</abbr> (I&#x2019;d settle for a.out) so I can run Lisp programmes on computers that don&#x2019;t have Lisp (i.e. my host&#x2019;s web server).</p>
