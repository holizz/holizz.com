<title>I am such a moron</title>
<p>Not only did I delete my database a few weeks ago, but today I was going to <code>sitecopy</code> holizz.com back to my local machine when I used <code>--update</code> instead of <code>--catchup</code> and deleted a good few files before I could stop it.

<p>I now have Internet at home so I will have this fixed soon (but not that soon). Then I will be blogging again.
