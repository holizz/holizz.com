<h1>AIFG with Mono</h1>
<p>This short <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOWTO">HOWTO</a> is for students of the AI for Games course at the <a href="http://www.brad.ac.uk/">University of Bradford</a> who wish to use <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono</a>.

<p>I'll assume you already know <em>why</em> you'd want to do this course, or use Mono, so I won't attempt to convince you on either point.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>This document is available at the following locations:
  <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.comp.brad.ac.uk/~tadams2/aifg-with-mono.html">www.comp.brad.ac.uk</a>
  <li><a href="http://holizz.com/software/doc/aifg-with-mono.html">holizz.com</a>
  </ul>
<li>Throughout this HOWTO I'll assume you're doing AIFG, have a computer at your disposal, can install software, and have a vague idea about what you're doing most of the time.
<li>AIFG uses .NET 2.0.
<li>Mono's WinForms implementation (at the time of writing) does not support the pretty GUI that Peter Cowling will give you. Do not despair, for you can use <code>GameForFastTesting</code> to run games for you. And if you're awfully smart you can write a player that queries a human for instructions.
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>You will need:
<ul>
<li>The libraries provided with each assignment
<li><code>gmcs</code> (<code>mcs</code> doesn't support .NET 2.0)
<li><code>mono</code>, if you intend to execute anything
</ul>

<p>In <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> (or derivatives, like <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>): <code>apt-get install mono-gmcs mono</code> as root should do the trick.

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<p>Let's start with a simple example from the Tanks game (2006/7, second assignment):

<pre>
namespace GridWorld
{
    public class UpTank : BasePlayer {
        public UpTank() : base() {
            Name = "UpTank";
        }
        public override ICommand GetTurnCommands(IPlayerWorldState igrid) {
            return new Command(Command.Move.Up, false);
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>I named the file <code>UpTank.cs</code> because it's a tank that moves up.

<p>If you stick the provided libraries in a directory called <code>lib</code>, the command to build our tank should look like this:

<p><code>gmcs -r:lib/Tanks.dll,lib/GridWorldEngine.dll,lib/GameInterface.dll -target:library UpTank.cs</code>

<dl>
<dt><code>-r:lib/Tanks.dll,lib/GridWorldEngine.dll,lib/GameInterface.dll</code>
<dd>The <code>-r</code> option tells <code>gmcs</code> where the extra libraries are. One or more of these will probably need changing for each assignment.

<dt><code>-target:library</code>
<dd>This tells <code>gmcs</code> that we're making a library. Otherwise it would whine about an entry point.
</dl>

<p>After that you should have <code>UpTank.dll</code> sitting next to <code>UpTank.cs</code>. Try running it in the GUI thing in the lab, or upload it to the server.

<h2>Execution</h2>

<p>Let's say you want to make a nice little executable to make use of <code>GameForFastTesting</code>, which is a class in the GridWorld namespace that plays games for you.

<p><code>Game.cs</code> is a little file containing a class called <code>Game</code> inside the <code>GridWorld</code> namespace. I won't give you it because it requires a lot of setting up, but here's a snippet:

<pre>
namespace GridWorld {
    class Game {
	public static void Main() {
            ...
        }
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Compilation is pretty much the same process, except you end up with something that's executable:

<p><code>gmcs -r:lib/Tanks.dll,lib/GridWorldEngine.dll,lib/GameInterface.dll,UpTank.dll -main:GridWorld.Game Game.cs</code>

<dl>
<dt><code>-r:lib/Tanks.dll,lib/GridWorldEngine.dll,lib/GameInterface.dll,UpTank.dll</code>
<dd>Same as before, although you should also include any players you wish to use (like our protagonist, <code>UpTank</code>).

<dt><code>-main:GridWorld.Game</code>
<dd>This tells <code>gmcs</code> where the entry point is - we want to enter our piece of software in the <code>Main</code> method of the <code>Game</code> class of the <code>GridWorld</code> namespace.
</dl>

<p>Now we should have <code>Game.exe</code> sitting next to <code>Game.cs</code>. Now let's execute it with one of the following commands:

<ul>
<li><code>MONO_PATH=lib mono Game.exe
<li><code>MONO_PATH=lib ./Game.exe
</ul>

<dl>
<dt><code>MONO_PATH=lib</code>
<dd>Before we <q>linked</q> to some stuff in the <code>lib</code> directory, and now we have to make reference to that once more so it can find its stuff. This is a normal environmental variable so you can run <code>MONO_PATH=lib; mono Game.exe</code> as two separate commands. Multiple paths in the variable should be separated by colons.
</dl>

<p>Now you should have some running code (or a load of exceptions). Rejoice, for you have broken free of Microsoft's monoculture just a little (Mono, monoculture, get it?).

<p>And now a thanks to the course's sponsors, Microsoft, without whom this course would not have been possible. We love you and all of your products (we just don't want to use them).
