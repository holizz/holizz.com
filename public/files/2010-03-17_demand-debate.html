<p>Dear Frank Dobson,</p>

<p>I've written to you about the Digital Economy Bill previously, outlining my concerns which are mainly on the subject of clauses 11 and 18 (though I have yet to receive a response). I am writing to you again to urge you to force a debate on the bill. It seems that the bill will be forced through the Commons in wash-up with minimal debate. Whatever your position on clauses 11 and 18, you must realise they require proper debate, even some lords mentioned that clause 18 needed cleaning-up in the Commons at the 3rd reading on Monday.</p>

<p>I am aware that if debate is demanded on the law, time may run out and the bill may not make it to the statute until after the general election. I know this may not be ideal and I believe the government intends to pass the bill during wash-up. But surely even the government must admit it is better to wait until after the election and let the bill pass through both houses again than to hurry the bill through wash-up and pass a bill which many have warned could lead to universities, libraries, businesses, and a great many innocent people being disconnected from the Internet without proper regard to due process.</p>

<p>I would be interested to hear whether you intend to demand proper debate over this clearly controversial piece of legislation, which I believe will have the opposite effect on this country's digital economy to the one intended by Lord Mandelson.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
Tom Adams</p>
