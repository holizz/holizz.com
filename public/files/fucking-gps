Hi,

I'm really fed up of my current GP only letting you book appointments on the same day (or 3 weeks in the future), requiring me to hit redail 20 times at 8.30am only to be eventually answered at 8.45am saying "sorry, you should have called sooner". Do you have this stupid policy? If not, I'd really like to register with you so I can get a prescription for some asthma meds which I haven't got yet thanks to my phone's alarm being broken leading to me forgetting to even phone them every morning for the past two weeks.

Thanks,
Tom Adams
