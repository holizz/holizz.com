Dear Lords Clement-Jones and Razzall,

I am writing to tell you that your proposed amendment to the digital economy bill starting "Preventing access to specified online locations" is a very bad idea. It should not be possible to curtail freedom of speech for a tort such as copyright. Also, we already have the Internet Watch Foundation's secret blacklist which most major ISPs subscribe to. If somebody wanted to censor vast swathes of the Web (which is what will happen if your amendment and the bill passes), they can already sneakily get the Web site added to the IWF's blacklist, so this legislation from the point of view of somebody working for the mainland Chinese governemnt, is unneccessary.

Yours sincerely,
Tom Adams
