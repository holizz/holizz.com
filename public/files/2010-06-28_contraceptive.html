Subject: Effectiveness of withdrawal as contraception

<p>Hi NHS Choices,

<p>I thought I was pretty well-informed about sex. When my partner suggested withdrawal as a contraceptive method I was very sceptical, as apparently, are you ("No one can stop themselves from leaking sperm before they come." [1]).

<p>However, she pointed me to research to the contrary[2], which lists the failure rate of withdrawal at 4% and that of condoms at 6% (with perfect technique - which suggests people _can_ stop themselves from leaking sperm before they come). I also found similar research[3] available on the NHS' site that lists withdrawal at 4% and condoms at 2% (again, perfect use).

<p>Have I just coincidentally stumbled across two pieces of research with duff findings? Could you point me towards the research you are basing your advice upon? (No paywalled journal links please, I'm not at university anymore).
