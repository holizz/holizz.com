Dear Frank Dobson,

The Digital Economy Bill is a really bad idea due to clauses 11 and 17. Clause 11 introduces a three-strikes legislation that will cut-off people who have been accused of infringing copyright three times. Nobody's human rights to free-association, free speech, access to government and private services, access to knowledge, among others, should be removed except in the extreme circumstances of being proven guilty of a crime (not a trivial tort such as copyright infringement without profiting from it) in a court of law, or temporarily by the police in the investigation of a criminial offence.

It should also be noted that if a business is accused of copyright infringement three times and their Internet connection is suspended, it could easily cause the business to fail (I don't think this is very good for Britain's digital economy). And also, a large institution like a university which provides Internet access to thousands of students and staff will easily be the source of more than three infringements per day.

Lord Mandelson claims it is possible to stop infringements occuring via technical measures, but it is demonstrably impossible to stop all copyright infringement on an Internet connection without cutting it off - you can infringe copyright using the same protocols you use to browse your council's Web site or send emails to your MP.

Clause 17, on the other hand allows the Secretary of State to change copyright law so long as it has something to do with "preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet", without passage through the Lords and Commons, which means it could be easily abused by Lord Mandelson or any future Secretary of State as a mechanism of censorship seeing as how it is technically a tort to visit any Web site that does not state that it is appropriately licensed to be copied (as when you visit a Web site its contents must be copied to your computer).

For these reasons, when the bill inevitably passes into the Commons it should be strongly opposed until these two clauses are removed.

Yours sincerely,
Tom Adams
