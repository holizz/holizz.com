<p>Dear Frank Dobson,

<p>I am writing to you regarding the coalition government's plan to extend anonymity in rape cases to the defendants as well as the victim. The anonymity is only provided to victims to attempt to fix the horrendously low rate of reporting of rape by assuring the (relative) safety for the victim. It is argued that accusation of rape permanently tarnishes reputations, however, on accusation of no other crime is the defendant granted anonymity. So by that logic, people accused of any crime should be granted anonymity due to the risk of a tarnished reputation.

<p>For that reason I would like to ask you to sign EDM105 "Anonymity For Defendants In Rape Cases". Thank you.

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
Tom Adams
