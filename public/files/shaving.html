<h2>Reasoning</h2>
<p>I started at about 11.45pm on New Year's Eve 2009 after a bit of a discussion in #bbw-chan (on Rizon). There were other people there who were balding and considering shaving their heads, and somebody who'd done exactly that who was saying how good it was to take back control. I'd been thinking about it for a while so I posted my photo and solicited opinions. The consensus was to shave, so I did.
<p>tl;dr peer pressure

<h2>Specifics</h2>
<p>It took me about 12 hours start to finish. 8 hours of hard-core shaving until all 5 of my cheap-o razors blunted (no I have not slept since 2009). Then I waited several hours for the shops to be open. I had to get a posh one because the little Sainsbury was all that was open and they didn't have any own-brand cheap-o ones. I got a Gilette Fusion. It's battery-powered and vibrates for maximum macho-awesomeness or whatever the packaging says. It's actually a lot more pleasant than the cheap-o ones, so maybe it was worth it.
<p>Would I do it again that way? No. It took way too long and I have way too many cuts. I'd pay a professional.
