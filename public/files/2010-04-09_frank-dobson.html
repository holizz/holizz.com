<p>Dear Frank Dobson,

<p>This is my third, or possibly fourth letter to you in regards to the Digital Economy Bill, which you voted in favour of at 11.03pm after (I presume, because I didn't see you there) turning up only for the divisions.

<p>We'll leave discussion of the problems with wash-up, whips, and the parliamentary process for another time. Now I just want to complain at you for not listening to my concerns, not even responding. The only correspondence I have from you is a letter telling me you voted in favour of some EDM I hadn't heard of let alone queried you about.

<p>I understand this seat is very secure for you, but for what it's worth, you don't have my vote and you continue to undermine the faith I never had in parliamentarians.

<p>Yours sincerely,<br>
Tom Adams
