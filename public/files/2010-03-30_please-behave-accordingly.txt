Dear Tenants



It saddens me a bit to have to write up such an email but we have
some-one actually stealing food from the fridge on the Ground floor.
Simply helping themselves to food items that do not belong to them.



We also have a prankster who uses the disabled / ladies
washroom /toilet facilities on the Ground floor, who spends their time
turning all the signage upside down. He/ she has recently had the time
to actually shorten the chain that holds the plug for the sink!



I will now  have to spend time looking at our CCTV cameras when I
really do have more important issues to deal with at Langdale House.



Thanking you in advance for your and consideration to other tenants
who work alongside you in the building.





Regards
