Subject: Your Web site<br>
<br>
If what I have written below is overly technical, please forward it to whoever is responsible for your Web site.<br>
<br>
Your Web site claims to conform to WCAG 1.0 to a AA standard (note the little "WAI-AA WCAG 1.0" button at the bottom of each page). This recommendation includes "7.3 Until user agents allow users to freeze moving content, avoid movement in pages. [Priority 2]". Your Web site contains two animated GIFs on each page, making this Web site very difficult to use for somebody like me who cannot concentrate on the page content with movement going on. I am thus having a very hard time figuring out what it is you stand for. Please either remove the lie at the bottom of the page (I could make a joke here about your party's lies about "can't win here" in the proportional representation EU elections last year), or (preferably) fix your Web site.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
