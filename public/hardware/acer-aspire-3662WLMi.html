<h1>Acer Aspire 3662WLMi</h1>
<p>Updated: 2008-05-16

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>As of <a href="http://kernel.org/">Linux</a> 2.6.24, everything I care about
works.

<p>As of <a href="http://openbsd.org/40.html">OpenBSD 4.0</a>, everything
besides <a href="#wifi">wireless networking</a> and <a href="#sound">sound</a>
works, with an <a href="#nic">odd networking bug</a>.

<p>As of <a href="http://openbsd.org/43.html">OpenBSD 4.3</a>, the sound is
still broken, but the wifi card is certainly recognised as <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=bwi&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&arch=i386&format=html">bwi(4)</a>.
I'm not entirely sure whether or not the networking bug is gone.

<p><a href="acer-aspire-3662WLMi_dmesg.txt">dmesg</a> on OpenBSD 4.3-RELEASE.

<h2>Problematic areas</h2>

<h3 id=wifi>Wireless networking</h3>

<p>Works fine in Ubuntu, with the default restricted drivers. Not tested in
OpenBSD.

<h3 id=nic>Networking</h3>

<p>Before Linux 2.6.19, networking was fine apart from <em>uploading</em> large
amounts of data (simply cuts out). OpenBSD 4.0 also has this bug.

<p>Currently, networking very occasionally cuts out under heavy and sustained
usage and rebooting seems to be the only cure (still occurring with Linux
2.6.22-rc1).

<h3 id=sound>Sound</h3>

<p>Somewhere between Linux 2.6.20 and 2.6.22-rc1, support for the sound card
was added. OpenBSD 4.3-RELEASE does not have support for this sound card.

<h3 id=mm>Multimedia keys</h3>

<p>By default, the Internet and Email keys bring up the Web browser and Email
client, and the play/pause key works in most applications. The volume up and
down keys also work.

<p>The P, e (Acer), stop, back, and forward keys have no keysym in the default
installation and so do nothing, but they <em>do</em> generate events and so can
be set as shortcuts.

<p>The euro and dollar keys do not, however, generate events and so only serve
to confuse the keyboard user. When using the laptop's keyboard - not often in
my case - I tended to have my fingers on the wrong keys due to a lack of
tactile feedback (that is to say, there is no gap between the inverted-T and
the surrounding keys). I could go on for days about the differences between the
laptop's keyboard and my Happy Hacking Lite II.

<p>Also, the email button seems to have a back-light. I've never seen it on,
and I haven't really tried to make it work.

<h3 id=gfx>Graphics</h3>

<p>Some Linux distributions have problems with getting X up and running. The
vast majority of distributions work fine without any effort (Ubuntu, openSUSE,
Debian, dyne:bolic, etc.). I haven't yet managed to get OpenBSD 4.0 running X,
although I'm not so familiar with OpenBSD. Update: X works on OpenBSD 4.3
without any effort on my part.

<p>Update: 3D acceleration works on Ubuntu with the default restricted driver.

<h3 id=ctrl>Ctrl key</h3>

<p>Like most computer keyboards these days, the Ctrl key is in the wrong place.
Thankfully though, the position is the only problem and can be easily fixed by
software (<code>kbd us.dvorak.swapctrlcaps</code>, etc.). (i.e. there isn't a
funny hole cut out of the caps lock to make pressing it harder).

<h3 id=card>5-in-1 card reader</h3>

<p>The 5-in-1 card reader works with SD, but not XD. I have not tried any other
cards with it.
