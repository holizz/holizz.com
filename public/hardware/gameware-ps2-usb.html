<h1>Gameware PS2/USB Adaptor</h1>
<p>Updated: 2008-05-29

<p>Gameware seems to be Game's own-brand. There were no system requirements
listed on the box, so I decided I could claim innocence if the product didn't
work.

<p>The device holds a single port for a single PS2 controller.

<p>The adaptor seems to follow the USB HID inteface, so I just plugged it in
(under Ubuntu 7.04), and changed the device configuration in ZSNES, and it just
worked.

<p>The analogue sticks also work fine.
