        <p>Welcome to my CV. Of course it isn&#x2019;t finished. But then what is?</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>

<p>See <a href="Contact">Contact</a>.</p>

<h3>Personal Aims</h3>

<p>I love to learn and I love to have fun. Anything that involves those two things is worthwhile.</p>

<p>
          <code>/* TODO */</code>
        </p>

<h3>Career Plan</h3>

<p>It is my intention to spend as long as possible in formal education (thus learning while protected from the scary four-letter &#x2018;w&#x2019; word). When I feel I&#x2019;ve learnt enough to start working properly (i.e. not side-work) I plan to get a job in some form; preferably Web-related programming.</p>

<p>

<h4>Other</h4>

<p>I have a City &amp; Guilds in C programming level 2. I also took a City &amp; Guilds in C++ (level 3?) and a <abbr title="Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People">CACDP</abbr> in <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> and failed them both.</p>

<h4>Degree</h4>

<p>I am currently studying for a <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BSc</abbr> in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.bradford.ac.uk/">University of Bradford</a>. These are the first-year modules I am currently studying:</p>

<ul>
<li>
            <cite>Computer Architecture and System Software</cite>: Boolean algebra, logic circuits. Interesting, challenging but kind of boring.</li>

<li>
            <cite>Formal Foundations</cite>: Teaching mathematics related to computing such as discrete mathematics, relations, probability theory and, currently, computer theory (regular expressions and finite automata thus far). Very interesting and rather challenging; not the most exciting lectures but certainly the most interesting.</li>

<li>
            <cite>Foundations of Human&#x2013;Computer Interaction</cite>: I studied this last semester. I passed the exam. I got the lowest pass possible (i.e. the lower boundary was 40% and I got 40%).</li>

<li>
            <cite>Introduction to Web Technologies</cite>: (It&#x2019;s about the Internet too). This is a terrible module (my colleagues and some staff agree and changes will be made, hopefully). The majority of the course relates to the Web which is a subject I am very well-versed in; it is easy. I get to argue with the lecturer about him forcing us to use tables for layout. The moron. (I had the idea this CV would be slightly professional-looking, but it needed to be said).</li>

<li>
            <cite>Key Skills For Computing Professionals</cite>: An assortment of things happen in this module. It is not overly-difficult and not overly-useful. (They taught us about brainstorms <abbr title="For Fuck&amp;#8217;s Sake">FFS</abbr>, this is university not middle school even though half the class may not act it).</li>

<li>
            <cite>Software Development (Programming)</cite>: Teaching object-orientated programming (as if it were the only way). Using the magic bullet known as Java. The only difficult thing is getting Java to work. If they let us hand assignments in in any language this would be piss-easy.</li>

<li>
            <cite>Software Development Tools and Design</cite>: Relating to various tools to help with programming (including teaching of Emacs, Makefile syntax and <abbr title="Unified Modelling Language">UML</abbr>). Not difficult, but interesting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Employment History</h3>

<h3>Skills</h3>

<p>I&#x2019;m skillful in the field of computing. Duh.</p>

<h4>Computer Languages</h4>

<p>These are languages that I currently use and enjoy. Thus languages I sort of know and languages I hate but use (Java) are not included.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>
          </dt>
<dd>I am not a graphic designer thus I am better at implementing CSS than designing layouts.</dd>

<dt>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">XHTML</a>
          </dt>
<dd>I have been using XHTML for a good while now. And before that I used HTML. I have a great deal of experience of creating semantic XHTML (by hand and using an XML parser) documents. (Shit, this is looking like a real CV in that everything seems so fake).</dd>

<dt>
            <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>
          </dt>
<dd>I know a little. Enough to write three MySQL-based CMSes.</dd>

<dt>
            <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>
          </dt>
<dd>I&#x2019;ve been using Python since soon after I read <cite>
              <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/">The Art of Unix Programming</a>
            </cite> (2004-06).</dd>

<dt>
            <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>
          </dt>
<dd>Using it since around 2005-01, experience with <a href="http://www.germane-software.com/software/rexml/">REXML</a> and such.</dd>

<dt>
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>
          </dt>
<dd>I do love working with random XML things such as XHTML and RDF.</dd>

<dt>Common Lisp</dt>
<dd>I&#x2019;m currently learning it (2005-03). I think it looks nice and fun.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Spoken Languages</h4>

<ul>
<li>English (en-GB): This is my first language and as a result I&#x2019;m quite good at it.</li>
<li>
            <abbr title="British Sign Language">BSL</abbr> (sgn-GB): I started learning this at about 17 and I took a course in it. For no adequitely explained reason I failed it (I was rather good at it). I&#x2019;m planning on doing another level 1 course with a friend next academic year (2005-05).</li>
<li>Esperanto (eo): I first started learning this in the 2004 Summer holidays but due to a lack of resources available I stopped learning. I am now learning it again and am confident that I shall really learn it this time.</li>
<li>I studied German at GCSE and all I got was this lousy C. I never especially liked German, but I enjoyed it more than French at first. I barely remember a word of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think of English as my first language, BSL as my second, and Esperanto as my third.</p>

<h4>Social Skills</h4>

<p>Or lack there of.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s no secret that my social skills are very poor. I expect them to continue improving over the course of my degree but I don&#x2019;t expect miracles.</p>

<p>
          <code>/* TODO: somehow portray my lack of social skills in a positive way */</code>
        </p>

<p>I hear learning languages improves one&#x2019;s social skills. That was certainly true while learning BSL but Esperanto may prove different as I shall primerily be using it online (as I know of nobody with a great interest in it in real life).</p>

<h3>Interests</h3>

<p>I have interests, you know. I have an interest in each field listed and also in each sub-field. Level of interest MUST NOT be inferred from its position in the hierarchy (teehee, I used <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt" title="Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels">RFC 2119</a> keywords).</p>

<ul>
<li>Computing
	<ul>
	<li>The Web
		<ul>
		<li>The Semantic Web</li>
		<li>Other random Web shit</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Body modification</li>
<li>Cooking</li>
</ul>

<h3>Referees</h3>

<p>Nobody yet. Maybe one day.</p>
